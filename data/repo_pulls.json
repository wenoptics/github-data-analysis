I\u2019m sending this refactoring suggestion in this PR.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to integrate these changes? If that is not the case, could you explain why this PR is not useful?

In the process I changed the `FullImageViewController` attachment bar animation to slide up/down from the bottom instead of dissolving in/out.\r\n* Add `FullscreenVideoViewController` to wrap `MPMoviePlayerVideoController` and provide similar transition zoom animations using a custom UIViewController transition animator.\r\n* Some related code cleanup\r\n\r\nThe commit messages provide some detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n* This should also fix Issue #1293. It does so by setting `self.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext` on the new view controller so the message view controller doesn't get torn down in the background. It's not ideal because the video controller is opaque, but the complexity of the alternative seemed worse. I saw Pull #1538, but in my testing that method would not really work because [the if block that scrolls to the bottom in `viewWillAppear`](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS/blob/0cd71b3b2ea93e4c3ad543108ea19214b5ab8ee6/Signal/src/ViewControllers/MessagesViewController.m#L550) does not do anything, I think because of `resetContentAndLayout` below. Further, in this case you would want to return to a precise scroll offset, not just ensure an index path is showing.\r\n* Before presenting `FullImageViewController` and `FullscreenVideoViewController` the keyboard needs to be dismissed so that the zoom out animation lines up.\r\n* Since multiple views in `FullImageViewController` were set to have a semi-transparent black background the resulting alpha level was not `kBackgroundAlpha` but something higher based on whatever blending iOS is using. I changed it so that only one view has a background color set and upped the constant to be closer to matching the current effective value.\r\n* As in the current version the zoom animations can potentially show up over the message controller navigation bar. My opinion is that the *best* solution is to take after Message.app and leave the navigation bar intact on zoom in instead of overlaying over the entire screen. This likely requires a custom movie player view instead of using `MPMoviePlayerController`.\r\n* I did take a shot at unifying the zoom animation code between `FullImageViewController` and `FullscreenVideoViewController`. Unfortunately given the wrangling required to use `MPMoviePlayerViewControler` I ended up with more complicated to share code. It probably would make sense to merge the two if `MPMoviePlayerViewControler` were ditched in favor of a custom player view controller. (And, in my opinion, going custom feels like a natural next step given a) `MPMoviePlayerViewControler` is deprecated and the new `AVPlayerViewController` is not as well suited in this context and b) it would make it possible to unify the UI with the image version and add the same share button.)\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\nI tested on a few devices and iOS 8, 9 and 10. I did my best to initiate the zooms from different scroll positions and keyboard states. Since I change the `MPMoviePlayerViewController` usage to not use its fullscreen mode (though it does use the fullscreen controls) I did testing that the video view is not dismissed prematurely and correctly dismissed for all relevant user interactions. \r\n", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-04-22T19:17:18", "merged_at": null, "comments": 0, "commits": 4, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

Thing is iRate performs first check to prompt during object creation and that is too early to set \u201eprevent\u201d flag. Way out of it is if app is being launched by remote notification, do not initialiseze iRate object. Testing was quite easy as I have setup iRate rules to fire everytime I open app and I have noticed that even if i explicitly set delegate method iRateShouldPromptForRating to NO, I still got first rating prompt during app launch.

{"repo_fullname": "mozilla-mobile/focus-ios", "user": "tgt", "title": "Improves contrast of action sheets when accessibility features enabled.", "body": "The Increase Contrast and Reduce Transparency accessibility features should improve accessibility. However, before this change enabling them caused the background of action sheets to become medium grey and the text to become a slightly lighter grey, which made the text hard to read. This prevents the problem by avoiding the use of a blur effect view when Reduce Transparency is enabled and using white text when Increase Contrast is enabled to prevent it from being darkened.\r\n\r\nThere're a few comments in the code where I think something better should be done, but I'm not sure of the best way.\r\n\r\n1. Where the TableViewBackgroundColor is defined I've written:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// It'd be better to compute this colour by blending Ink90 with grey to emulate the layering\r\n// done when reduce transparency is disabled\r\nreturn UIColor(rgb: 0x454558)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Where the darkerSystemColorsStatusDidChangeNotification observer is defined I've written:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// Is there a better way to have the text redrawn to make sure contrast isn't affected?\r\nself.tableView.reloadData()\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Where PhotonActionSheet.tintColor is defined I've changed to a computed property that returns white when  the user has enabled Increase Contrast. This prevents the text colour from being darkened when the setting is enabled. There may be a way to simply prevent a label from being affected by Increase Contrast, but I'm not aware of it.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// Light grey is darkened, which reduces contrast on a dark background,\r\n// so use white instead when the user has enabled the Increase Contrast\r\n// accessibility setting\r\nif UIAccessibility.isDarkerSystemColorsEnabled {\r\n    return UIConstants.Photon.White100\r\n} else {\r\n    return UIConstants.Photon.Grey10\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've attached several images showing the previous problems and how things look after my changes:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"original\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660282-9b2c2280-db8e-11e8-8f03-720fbb62c5bb.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"increase contrast\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660287-9ebfa980-db8e-11e8-978c-cb039a301ac8.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"reduce transparency\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660293-a0896d00-db8e-11e8-8b90-f236010201b8.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"reduce transparency and increase contrast\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660300-a2ebc700-db8e-11e8-9764-0ad408e61beb.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"reduce transparency and increase contrast after code changes\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660310-a54e2100-db8e-11e8-9758-4c5502bd6b24.png\">\r\n", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-10-29T15:31:15", "merged_at": null, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

This pull request has a lot of stuff in it, so let me go over it:\r\n\r\n* Uses SFSafariViewController wherever HNWebViewController was used. Not much to say here since it was mostly a drop-in replacement.\r\n* Support of 3D Touch wherever it seems appropriate\u2013the link in the feed, the comments button in the feed, and the link in the header in the comments view.\r\n* Replace an en dash that was bothering me with a minus sign (which has the same width as a plus sign).\r\n\r\nAlso, there's a slightly controversial change of collapsing comments by tapping on them. This might not be what you want, so I'm fine with dropping it, but my rationale behind it was that there was no action performed by tapping on cells anyways so why not?\r\n\r\nFinally, this pull request has *full* iOS 11 support. In particular, it fixes a couple of legacy issues and adapts the new large titles, integrated `UISearchController`/`UIRefreshControl`, etc. Plus there's a couple of fixes for warnings and whatnot. I know there are other pull requests for a subset of the things in mine, but they're not quite there. In particular, #19 doesn't actually fix the comment layout views, which fly off the screen, #22 uses private API to turn the search bar white and keeps a separate results controller, which I think introduces complexity.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that this pull request doesn't actually merge cleanly; this was done on purpose. I'm requesting that if you merge this, you do so as-is. The reason for this is that some recent commits have introduced some changes that aren't really necessary (especially with regards to updated Cocoapods), and I've gone through and manually picked out the useful bits. Of course, this makes the pull request seem behind your master branch, but Cocoapods should be up to date.\r\n", "changed_files": 127, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-01-18T11:47:22", "merged_at": null, "comments": 1, "commits": 7, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

Not sure it's totally ready to be merged - I'm still not that comfortable with ObjC, so some code review would be required, and there are some cosmetic issues that could probably be fixed.\n\nThis adds support for displaying one time passwords, as requested in issue #225, using the KeeOTP format (I believe!) for data. e.g.\n\n```\nkey=PEHMPSDNLXIOG65U&step=30&size=6\n```\n\nOnly `key` is required, step defaults to 30 and size to 6.  This data can be in the notes (for kdb and kdbx files) or in a string field (kdbx only).  In the notes, it has to be prefixed with `otp:`, and the string field name has to be `otp`.  A QR code for the above key can be found on [this page](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2011/07/google-totp-two-factor-authentication-for-php/) if you want to compare the values to another OTP generator.\n\nI branched [aerogear-otp-ios](https://github.com/markhewett/aerogear-otp-ios) to add support for the things I needed and added that as a submodule (hopefully that part is correct, I'm not comfortable with Git either!).\n\nHere's what it looks like in a kdb file:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 39 03 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324345/2bfdd536-7c9f-11e4-9318-636c11c34a45.png)\n\nHere's the same entry when the OTP is about to expire:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 39 24 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324351/3e6f4c22-7c9f-11e4-94f5-c2bbc06f1340.png)\n\nHere's what it looks like in a kdbx file:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 40 01 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324357/4d521e7c-7c9f-11e4-84e6-704b1096ed78.png)\n\nAs you can see, the alignment of the \"clock\" icon is a bit off, but I'm not sure how to fix that.\n\nI did add a new button in the browser to paste the OTP, but it needs a new icon, instead of the duplicate asterisk:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 40 17 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324363/5fb8acac-7c9f-11e4-9b92-16ec520cd10c.png)\n\nLet me know what you think - what improvements need to be made, or if you don't want to add this, etc.\n", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2014-12-05T22:58:10", "merged_at": null, "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

I also changed the NSError type to Error in URLSessionDownloadTask. \r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed a bug (see screenshot) where the optional values of locality, postalCode, adminArea, and country were never actually getting unwrapped.

I know the code is a pile of garbage as-is, but it works for testing and the improvement is substantial. As this change introduces no new dependecies (libjpeg-turbo is already a hard dependecy of Kodi, as I see it) and does not introduce new features (but improves the performance of an existing feature), I opted not to implement it as an addon.

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "AlwinEsch", "title": "[addons] remove cpluff", "body": "## Description\r\nThis request removes the use of \"cpluff\" in Kodi.\r\n\r\n**Why should be cpluff removed:**\r\ncpluff was designed to run a complete addon management. This includes not only loading the addon data, but also using and running these addons.\r\n\r\nKodi has only used the loading of addon.xml. This can also be done quite easily by yourself.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the performance of cpluff is rather bad and Kodi must always retry the data stored in it to create its matching data structure. Therefore, the data passes through twice in the system, once in cpluff and once in Kodi.\r\n\r\nAlso, cpluff does not allow to easily work together multiple addon types in an addon itself, see Binary addons. There is only information related to the respective addon type and no other type in it.\r\n\r\n**What does this:**\r\nIt searches the addons stored in the system or reads the data given by the repository and then creates it from the found xml file. Or by using [CAddonInfoBuilder::CFromDB](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-d468e80a368d09a27acf00bab3edf35fR29) from database.\r\n\r\nFor local addons, the information created with [CAddonInfoBuilder::Generate](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-11ac4eb50187a8acb45199c341852086R51) is then stored in the manager (instead of in cpluff). In the case of a request, the associated CAddonInfo will then be issued.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a change, this list will be replaced or an entry removed (as before). Because these are given as shared memory, conflicts are ruled out if used elsewhere (similar to the previous ones where the classes were copied instead).\r\n\r\n**What changed here:**\r\nThis contains only the minimal changes and the access to the AddonManager remains as before.\r\n\r\nOnly the \"FromExtension\" is removed at the respective addon classes and replaced with a new path.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CAddonInfo is no longer passed with a static address but with a shared pointer because the CAddonInfo is already stored in the AddonManager and must remain there.\r\n\r\nThis is another try. But definitely something has to be done because with cpluff, Kodi comes to its limits and the previous code (also by me for advanced abilities) is very disgusted.\r\n\r\nPlease do not come back with \"no, no\", if it does not fit, help me or bring a good one yourself.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nTo finally make the addon system more extensible and secure\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- [X] Test code system added\r\n- [ ] Test with mostly all available addons\r\n- [ ] Test automatic updates\r\n- [x] Test uninstall / update to becomes not more bad\r\n- [ ] Test with bad addon.xml's\r\n- [ ] Test on all OS's (related e.g. to binary download on Windows)\r\n- [x] Confirm current binary addon system works normal\r\n- [X] Repository addon install over ZIP Ok (still need Kodi restart like before, to download included addons)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

This are:\r\n1. Addon class \"CPresentShader\"\r\n    - It allow addon to use Kodi's basic predefined shaders from CRenderSystemGL or CRenderSystemGLES\r\n    - This is then the most easiest way for a addon to get shader. Tested on asteroids screensaver and works good\r\n2. Addon class \"CShader\" and \"CShaderProgram\"\r\n    - This allow the use of more complex shaders where load becomes handled from Kodi. This makes it on addon side more easy to handle differences between different OS's and GL Versions.\r\n    - Before was for more complex OpenGL shading a extra code on addons needed to handle this load.\r\n    - This support the load of Kodi's own shaders or own from addon where it give his folder to Kodi\r\n    - Test of them works good.\r\n3. Addon class \"CMatrix\"\r\n    - It has now a interface for the Matrix Processing on OpenGL\r\n    - This allow the for performance optimized code to use on addon\r\n4. Addon class \"CMatrixStack\"\r\n    - This is a special stack handler, over static functions there can the addon use the Matrix Stack's from Kodi for him.\r\n    - Further can it create the class by self new who make a own stack on addon.\r\n    - This code is currently not tested.\r\n\r\n**Just as an example of an idea, not sure if it's acceptable.

For UDP streams, it is set to false. But this is later overwritten by:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// iformat is NULL because it is a udp stream and we don\u2019t have the format type in advance\r\nelse if (!iformat || (strcmp(iformat->name, \u201cmpegts\u201d) != 0))\r\n{\r\nm_streaminfo = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe must be careful.\r\n\r\n* If we completely disable the streaminfo request, video is not rendered at all.\r\n* Setting the timeout to a hundred milliseconds works, but may not be safe.

This value has been chosen because it is used in ffmpeg and this value is even cited as being set as such to fix slow IPTV channel changes for Kodi. \r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThis has been included in OSMC since early January on Kodi Krypton without reports of issues.\r\nIt has also been included with our Kodi Leia test builds, but this does attract fewer users. \r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

I was thinking about adding an externals folder but with curl maybe ending up being the only wrapper it made little sense.\r\n\r\ng_curlInterface and it's caching of connections is gone to avoid global state management that at best provides a negligible performance increase.\r\n\r\nA very simple class `CCurlGlobalInit` is added that's only job is to init/deinit curl globally and set up locks for static linking.\r\n\r\n### Doubt ###\r\nAfter I started on this I started doubting myself a bit so curious about others thoughts on this. Same goal can probably be achieved with a somewhat redesigned `CCurlFile`.\r\n\r\nMaybe use `std::error_condition` instead of `std::error_code` as I learned that technically std::error_code is for system errors and std::error_condition is for \"other\" errors.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your change in detail -->\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

I open the PR because of #12225 and because I need input on how to handle configuring the list of allowed domains. I also haven't done much testing yet because I don't have a client ready to hand.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nIn general browsers don't allow performing POST requests from one domain to another due to security reasons. This however can stop clients from interacting with Kodi. The solution for this is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which adds additional HTTP headers to the request and responses indicating whether CORS is supported or not.\r\nDue to this being a potential security issue (if not properly configured) CORS is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled by the user in the settings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the proper thing to do would be to ask the user to configure the list of domains which should be allowed to use CORS. This is however very technical and I'm not sure how best to integrate this into the user interface which is why I haven't done it yet. Right now when CORS is enabled the webserver accepts cross domain requests from any domain.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-06-06T07:15:39", "merged_at": null, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "mergeable": true, "review_comments": 2, "state": "open"}

Made existing code more readable, inspired by [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133)\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nWhenever I delete a movie on my NAS, a video library clean on Kodi removes not only the movie from the database, but also the entire path (folder and its movies)! \r\n\r\nI am using a movie structure like this:\r\nSourceVideoFolder (\"Movies\")\r\n---QualityFolder (like \"HD\", \"SD\", \"4k\" etc.)\r\n------YearFolder (like \"1900-1999\", \"2000-2010\" etc)\r\n---------Movies\r\n\r\nThis happens, because in function CleanMediaType() the pathsDeleteDecisions wrongly got only the bool \"del\" (corresponds if the missing movie should be deleted), instead of also checking if the folder still exists. The path shouldn't get deleted if it exists.\r\n\r\nIn [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133) anaconda also ran into a similar issue, as mentioned in the comments (on Oct 25, 2015), but they didn't solve the issue.

It should compile on Android but I didn't runtime test it. OSX/iOS is completely untested.

Furthermore it supports named loggers which should make logging in the code much easier and also make the log file easier to read because every class/instance follows the same guidelines (right now every class logs their class name differently or not at all). As an example I've implemented a named logger for the `CWebServer` class in 9ed2953de94f50cc578cfad1af18b873c33817e7.\r\n\r\nUsing templates I also managed to get rid of the difference between `Log` and `LogW` which makes the interface of `CLog` easier to use.\r\n\r\nI had to fix some log messages (all collected in 6f1e4a6fb0e29fb693270335f1084cb36d41a9b6) because they didn't match in type and therefore weren't type safe.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nLocal testing on windows.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n- [ ] better solution for `gai_strerror()` as char/wchar_t\r\n- [ ] fix pkgconfig version\r\n- [ ] fixed width for thread id and log level\r\n- [ ] find a solution for `LOGINFO` vs. `LOGNOTICE`\r\n- [x] add `TARGET_WIN10` defines\r\n- [x] get rid of unnecessary trailing newlines in log messages\r\n- [x] fix crash in `CDVDDemuxClient`", "changed_files": 135, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-03-09T12:51:56", "merged_at": null, "comments": 42, "commits": 6, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 10, "state": "open"}

This will probably replace our current patches in LibreELEC regardless of if they are accepted here or not. If this isn't something that we want in Kodi then it would still be nice to get some comments about the code quality (I'm no c++ dev). \r\n\r\nThis allows running systemd services that are inside the add-on. On LibreELEC because we use Kodi's add-on system as the package manager. We provide binary add-ons that can contain services (like tvheadend, docker, etc). These services are started via systemd service files. We previously maintained an ugly patch to start these services. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/aadeef8bdff40ae19cb61f1206ff30ebbaebb8bb and [here](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv/blob/master/packages/mediacenter/kodi/scripts/systemd-addon-wrapper)\r\n\r\nI wanted to make something that is cleaner and using proper methods. Since Kodi has a DBus method already it was rather simple to use that. So when add-ons are enabled/disabled dbus calls the systemd manager to enable/disable and start/stop service units.\r\n\r\nThe second commit extends this to add timedated support to allow setting the host OS timezone from within kodi. LibreELEC again maintained a patch for this. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/fb5c7a43280419bfa464b945da3b46f74782f0ad\r\n\r\nI decided to only depend on dbus because that's what is done in [LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/powermanagement/linux/LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp) as it doesn't look for systemd or upower.\r\n\r\nI'll probably add some logging to SystemdUtils.cpp eventually.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "dgam1", "title": "JSON: Handle option \"resume\" when opening playlists", "body": "The issue I'm trying to fix here is that when you send a JSON query of type \"Player.Open\", using playlistid and position as parameters, the option \"resume\" gets silently ignored. To reproduce it, send these queries (with a loaded video playlist):\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": false}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": 50.0}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": {\"hours\": 0, \"seconds\": 10, \"minutes\": 10, \"milliseconds\": 10}}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes I implemented are:\r\nxbmc/interfaces/json-rpc/PlayerOperations.cpp:\r\nIn CPlayerOperations::Open when opening a playlist by id and position, it doesn't send message TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY anymore but TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, attaching as payload a pointer to a CVariant containing either a double (percentage) or an int (-1 for STARTOFFSET_RESUME or number of seconds offset).\r\n\r\nxbmc/PlayListPlayer.cpp:\r\nPLAYLIST::CPlayListPlayer::OnApplicationMessage, handling the message TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, now reads param2 as the playlistid and the payload pointer as the pointer to the CVariant instance containing the resume value. It will set the current playlist, if needed. Before this patch, this was done in TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY. I removed that part from the handler of the latter message since the only occurrence in the code base of using TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY to open a specific playlist at a specific position was in the JSON handler that I changed above.\r\nAlso, in CPlayListPlayer::Play the start offset and percentage both always get reset.\r\n\r\nxbmc/Application.cpp:\r\nReset the property \"StartPercent\" from m_itemCurrentFile as otherwise the property will be set again on the original item in the playlist, once the playback ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these changes resume works as expected on videos. With music it works when you supply a specific time (but the display will act as if the file is being played from the beginning), percentage and STARTOFFSET_RESUME currently get ignored by the music player, which is outside of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

That function will then check the file for ordered chapters. If the file doesn't use ordered chapters a nullptr is returned, and the factory returns the ffmpeg demuxer as usual.\nIf the file uses ordered chapters a CDemuxTimeline gets created. It takes over the ffmpeg demuxer as \"primaryDemuxer\", and gets returned by the factory instead of the ffmpeg demuxer. The timeline creation may involve searching for missing mkv segments in the same directory as the source file if necessary.\n## Motivation and Context\n\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "DaveTBlake", "title": "Smart playlists: fix how song based rules applied to artists and albums lists", "body": "Since adding role and path rules to \"artists\" type smart playlists I realised that all the rules based on song criteria e.g. genre, path and role, rather than simply a field in the artist table, need to be combined in SQL rather than left as spearate SQL clauses for each rule.\n\nIn logic terms the artists with songs satisfying criteria A and songs satisfying criteria B is not the always same as those artists with songs satisfying criteria A and B.\n\nThe effects of this can be seen in Jarvis with an \"artists\" smart playlist with 2 genre rules: genre = A AND genre = B - what is wanted is all artists with songs that have both genre A and B, what you get is artists that have both at least a song  with genre A and at least a song with genre B. This is not major, but once role and path rule combinations are possible as in v17 then the impact becomes more significant.\n\nAlso having selected a playlist of artists using song criteria when that list is played it is the songs that satisfy those criteraia that are wanted. Say for example the artist has some songs of genre Jazz and other songs are Rock. You make a playlist of Jazz artists i.e. artists with songs of genre = Jazz, then currently when you play that list you would get all the songs by that artist rather than just the Jazz ones. Hence song based rules need transfering to filter the subsequent list of albums or songs shown when navigating down from an artist on smart playlist or when playing that list.\n\nThis is particularly important when there are role rules e.g. \"artist is composer\", currently clicking on a composer from such an artist list can result in nothing being displayed despite the fact thay they do compose some songs because the role rule is not passed to the list of albums or artists.\n", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2016-07-10T10:37:01", "merged_at": null, "comments": 14, "commits": 10, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

He even can activate an auto update feature without user interaction.\n\nIf you wonder why there is a public key in those commits. For security reasons we have to sign the DMG so that the updater can verify that the update is really done by us (i would hook the signing up to the release jenkins job - or the alpha job in case we want to provide alpha update via sparkle).\n\nBasically the signing is done because of the same reasons we have to sign the apk file for android.\n\nWhat do you think? (given the risk free integration we could even think about taking this into 14.2 - once its in we can publish versions via an serverside xml).\n\nAs you can see the updatexml which holds the metadata about available updates can be defined in version.txt (in case we want to have different files for alpha and final releases). For now i just would put them to the osx downloads on the mirror.\n\nOnce we release we just kick the jenkins job (which is not adapted yet) which signs the dmg - the sign process results in an dsa key hash which has to be added to the xml file (this is manual work - like when i update cydia repo).

I know the code is a pile of garbage as-is, but it works for testing and the improvement is substantial. As this change introduces no new dependecies (libjpeg-turbo is already a hard dependecy of Kodi, as I see it) and does not introduce new features (but improves the performance of an existing feature), I opted not to implement it as an addon.

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "AlwinEsch", "title": "[addons] remove cpluff", "body": "## Description\r\nThis request removes the use of \"cpluff\" in Kodi.\r\n\r\n**Why should be cpluff removed:**\r\ncpluff was designed to run a complete addon management. This includes not only loading the addon data, but also using and running these addons.\r\n\r\nKodi has only used the loading of addon.xml. This can also be done quite easily by yourself.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the performance of cpluff is rather bad and Kodi must always retry the data stored in it to create its matching data structure. Therefore, the data passes through twice in the system, once in cpluff and once in Kodi.\r\n\r\nAlso, cpluff does not allow to easily work together multiple addon types in an addon itself, see Binary addons. There is only information related to the respective addon type and no other type in it.\r\n\r\n**What does this:**\r\nIt searches the addons stored in the system or reads the data given by the repository and then creates it from the found xml file. Or by using [CAddonInfoBuilder::CFromDB](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-d468e80a368d09a27acf00bab3edf35fR29) from database.\r\n\r\nFor local addons, the information created with [CAddonInfoBuilder::Generate](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-11ac4eb50187a8acb45199c341852086R51) is then stored in the manager (instead of in cpluff). In the case of a request, the associated CAddonInfo will then be issued.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a change, this list will be replaced or an entry removed (as before). Because these are given as shared memory, conflicts are ruled out if used elsewhere (similar to the previous ones where the classes were copied instead).\r\n\r\n**What changed here:**\r\nThis contains only the minimal changes and the access to the AddonManager remains as before.\r\n\r\nOnly the \"FromExtension\" is removed at the respective addon classes and replaced with a new path.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CAddonInfo is no longer passed with a static address but with a shared pointer because the CAddonInfo is already stored in the AddonManager and must remain there.\r\n\r\nThis is another try. But definitely something has to be done because with cpluff, Kodi comes to its limits and the previous code (also by me for advanced abilities) is very disgusted.\r\n\r\nPlease do not come back with \"no, no\", if it does not fit, help me or bring a good one yourself.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nTo finally make the addon system more extensible and secure\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- [X] Test code system added\r\n- [ ] Test with mostly all available addons\r\n- [ ] Test automatic updates\r\n- [x] Test uninstall / update to becomes not more bad\r\n- [ ] Test with bad addon.xml's\r\n- [ ] Test on all OS's (related e.g. to binary download on Windows)\r\n- [x] Confirm current binary addon system works normal\r\n- [X] Repository addon install over ZIP Ok (still need Kodi restart like before, to download included addons)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

This are:\r\n1. Addon class \"CPresentShader\"\r\n    - It allow addon to use Kodi's basic predefined shaders from CRenderSystemGL or CRenderSystemGLES\r\n    - This is then the most easiest way for a addon to get shader. Tested on asteroids screensaver and works good\r\n2. Addon class \"CShader\" and \"CShaderProgram\"\r\n    - This allow the use of more complex shaders where load becomes handled from Kodi. This makes it on addon side more easy to handle differences between different OS's and GL Versions.\r\n    - Before was for more complex OpenGL shading a extra code on addons needed to handle this load.\r\n    - This support the load of Kodi's own shaders or own from addon where it give his folder to Kodi\r\n    - Test of them works good.\r\n3. Addon class \"CMatrix\"\r\n    - It has now a interface for the Matrix Processing on OpenGL\r\n    - This allow the for performance optimized code to use on addon\r\n4. Addon class \"CMatrixStack\"\r\n    - This is a special stack handler, over static functions there can the addon use the Matrix Stack's from Kodi for him.\r\n    - Further can it create the class by self new who make a own stack on addon.\r\n    - This code is currently not tested.\r\n\r\n**Just as an example of an idea, not sure if it's acceptable.

For UDP streams, it is set to false. But this is later overwritten by:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// iformat is NULL because it is a udp stream and we don\u2019t have the format type in advance\r\nelse if (!iformat || (strcmp(iformat->name, \u201cmpegts\u201d) != 0))\r\n{\r\nm_streaminfo = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe must be careful.\r\n\r\n* If we completely disable the streaminfo request, video is not rendered at all.\r\n* Setting the timeout to a hundred milliseconds works, but may not be safe.

This value has been chosen because it is used in ffmpeg and this value is even cited as being set as such to fix slow IPTV channel changes for Kodi. \r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThis has been included in OSMC since early January on Kodi Krypton without reports of issues.\r\nIt has also been included with our Kodi Leia test builds, but this does attract fewer users. \r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

I was thinking about adding an externals folder but with curl maybe ending up being the only wrapper it made little sense.\r\n\r\ng_curlInterface and it's caching of connections is gone to avoid global state management that at best provides a negligible performance increase.\r\n\r\nA very simple class `CCurlGlobalInit` is added that's only job is to init/deinit curl globally and set up locks for static linking.\r\n\r\n### Doubt ###\r\nAfter I started on this I started doubting myself a bit so curious about others thoughts on this. Same goal can probably be achieved with a somewhat redesigned `CCurlFile`.\r\n\r\nMaybe use `std::error_condition` instead of `std::error_code` as I learned that technically std::error_code is for system errors and std::error_condition is for \"other\" errors.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your change in detail -->\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

I open the PR because of #12225 and because I need input on how to handle configuring the list of allowed domains. I also haven't done much testing yet because I don't have a client ready to hand.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nIn general browsers don't allow performing POST requests from one domain to another due to security reasons. This however can stop clients from interacting with Kodi. The solution for this is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which adds additional HTTP headers to the request and responses indicating whether CORS is supported or not.\r\nDue to this being a potential security issue (if not properly configured) CORS is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled by the user in the settings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the proper thing to do would be to ask the user to configure the list of domains which should be allowed to use CORS. This is however very technical and I'm not sure how best to integrate this into the user interface which is why I haven't done it yet. Right now when CORS is enabled the webserver accepts cross domain requests from any domain.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-06-06T07:15:39", "merged_at": null, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "mergeable": true, "review_comments": 2, "state": "open"}

Made existing code more readable, inspired by [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133)\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nWhenever I delete a movie on my NAS, a video library clean on Kodi removes not only the movie from the database, but also the entire path (folder and its movies)! \r\n\r\nI am using a movie structure like this:\r\nSourceVideoFolder (\"Movies\")\r\n---QualityFolder (like \"HD\", \"SD\", \"4k\" etc.)\r\n------YearFolder (like \"1900-1999\", \"2000-2010\" etc)\r\n---------Movies\r\n\r\nThis happens, because in function CleanMediaType() the pathsDeleteDecisions wrongly got only the bool \"del\" (corresponds if the missing movie should be deleted), instead of also checking if the folder still exists. The path shouldn't get deleted if it exists.\r\n\r\nIn [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133) anaconda also ran into a similar issue, as mentioned in the comments (on Oct 25, 2015), but they didn't solve the issue.

It should compile on Android but I didn't runtime test it. OSX/iOS is completely untested.

Furthermore it supports named loggers which should make logging in the code much easier and also make the log file easier to read because every class/instance follows the same guidelines (right now every class logs their class name differently or not at all). As an example I've implemented a named logger for the `CWebServer` class in 9ed2953de94f50cc578cfad1af18b873c33817e7.\r\n\r\nUsing templates I also managed to get rid of the difference between `Log` and `LogW` which makes the interface of `CLog` easier to use.\r\n\r\nI had to fix some log messages (all collected in 6f1e4a6fb0e29fb693270335f1084cb36d41a9b6) because they didn't match in type and therefore weren't type safe.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nLocal testing on windows.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n- [ ] better solution for `gai_strerror()` as char/wchar_t\r\n- [ ] fix pkgconfig version\r\n- [ ] fixed width for thread id and log level\r\n- [ ] find a solution for `LOGINFO` vs. `LOGNOTICE`\r\n- [x] add `TARGET_WIN10` defines\r\n- [x] get rid of unnecessary trailing newlines in log messages\r\n- [x] fix crash in `CDVDDemuxClient`", "changed_files": 135, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-03-09T12:51:56", "merged_at": null, "comments": 42, "commits": 6, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 10, "state": "open"}

This will probably replace our current patches in LibreELEC regardless of if they are accepted here or not. If this isn't something that we want in Kodi then it would still be nice to get some comments about the code quality (I'm no c++ dev). \r\n\r\nThis allows running systemd services that are inside the add-on. On LibreELEC because we use Kodi's add-on system as the package manager. We provide binary add-ons that can contain services (like tvheadend, docker, etc). These services are started via systemd service files. We previously maintained an ugly patch to start these services. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/aadeef8bdff40ae19cb61f1206ff30ebbaebb8bb and [here](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv/blob/master/packages/mediacenter/kodi/scripts/systemd-addon-wrapper)\r\n\r\nI wanted to make something that is cleaner and using proper methods. Since Kodi has a DBus method already it was rather simple to use that. So when add-ons are enabled/disabled dbus calls the systemd manager to enable/disable and start/stop service units.\r\n\r\nThe second commit extends this to add timedated support to allow setting the host OS timezone from within kodi. LibreELEC again maintained a patch for this. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/fb5c7a43280419bfa464b945da3b46f74782f0ad\r\n\r\nI decided to only depend on dbus because that's what is done in [LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/powermanagement/linux/LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp) as it doesn't look for systemd or upower.\r\n\r\nI'll probably add some logging to SystemdUtils.cpp eventually.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "dgam1", "title": "JSON: Handle option \"resume\" when opening playlists", "body": "The issue I'm trying to fix here is that when you send a JSON query of type \"Player.Open\", using playlistid and position as parameters, the option \"resume\" gets silently ignored. To reproduce it, send these queries (with a loaded video playlist):\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": false}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": 50.0}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": {\"hours\": 0, \"seconds\": 10, \"minutes\": 10, \"milliseconds\": 10}}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes I implemented are:\r\nxbmc/interfaces/json-rpc/PlayerOperations.cpp:\r\nIn CPlayerOperations::Open when opening a playlist by id and position, it doesn't send message TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY anymore but TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, attaching as payload a pointer to a CVariant containing either a double (percentage) or an int (-1 for STARTOFFSET_RESUME or number of seconds offset).\r\n\r\nxbmc/PlayListPlayer.cpp:\r\nPLAYLIST::CPlayListPlayer::OnApplicationMessage, handling the message TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, now reads param2 as the playlistid and the payload pointer as the pointer to the CVariant instance containing the resume value. It will set the current playlist, if needed. Before this patch, this was done in TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY. I removed that part from the handler of the latter message since the only occurrence in the code base of using TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY to open a specific playlist at a specific position was in the JSON handler that I changed above.\r\nAlso, in CPlayListPlayer::Play the start offset and percentage both always get reset.\r\n\r\nxbmc/Application.cpp:\r\nReset the property \"StartPercent\" from m_itemCurrentFile as otherwise the property will be set again on the original item in the playlist, once the playback ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these changes resume works as expected on videos. With music it works when you supply a specific time (but the display will act as if the file is being played from the beginning), percentage and STARTOFFSET_RESUME currently get ignored by the music player, which is outside of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

That function will then check the file for ordered chapters. If the file doesn't use ordered chapters a nullptr is returned, and the factory returns the ffmpeg demuxer as usual.\nIf the file uses ordered chapters a CDemuxTimeline gets created. It takes over the ffmpeg demuxer as \"primaryDemuxer\", and gets returned by the factory instead of the ffmpeg demuxer. The timeline creation may involve searching for missing mkv segments in the same directory as the source file if necessary.\n## Motivation and Context\n\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "DaveTBlake", "title": "Smart playlists: fix how song based rules applied to artists and albums lists", "body": "Since adding role and path rules to \"artists\" type smart playlists I realised that all the rules based on song criteria e.g. genre, path and role, rather than simply a field in the artist table, need to be combined in SQL rather than left as spearate SQL clauses for each rule.\n\nIn logic terms the artists with songs satisfying criteria A and songs satisfying criteria B is not the always same as those artists with songs satisfying criteria A and B.\n\nThe effects of this can be seen in Jarvis with an \"artists\" smart playlist with 2 genre rules: genre = A AND genre = B - what is wanted is all artists with songs that have both genre A and B, what you get is artists that have both at least a song  with genre A and at least a song with genre B. This is not major, but once role and path rule combinations are possible as in v17 then the impact becomes more significant.\n\nAlso having selected a playlist of artists using song criteria when that list is played it is the songs that satisfy those criteraia that are wanted. Say for example the artist has some songs of genre Jazz and other songs are Rock. You make a playlist of Jazz artists i.e. artists with songs of genre = Jazz, then currently when you play that list you would get all the songs by that artist rather than just the Jazz ones. Hence song based rules need transfering to filter the subsequent list of albums or songs shown when navigating down from an artist on smart playlist or when playing that list.\n\nThis is particularly important when there are role rules e.g. \"artist is composer\", currently clicking on a composer from such an artist list can result in nothing being displayed despite the fact thay they do compose some songs because the role rule is not passed to the list of albums or artists.\n", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2016-07-10T10:37:01", "merged_at": null, "comments": 14, "commits": 10, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

He also can decide to skip only one version of kodi or if he doesn't want to update now he can delay it. He even can activate an auto update feature without user interaction.\n\nIf you wonder why there is a public key in those commits. For security reasons we have to sign the DMG so that the updater can verify that the update is really done by us (i would hook the signing up to the release jenkins job - or the alpha job in case we want to provide alpha update via sparkle).\n\nBasically the signing is done because of the same reasons we have to sign the apk file for android.\n\nWhat do you think? (given the risk free integration we could even think about taking this into 14.2 - once its in we can publish versions via an serverside xml).\n\nAs you can see the updatexml which holds the metadata about available updates can be defined in version.txt (in case we want to have different files for alpha and final releases). For now i just would put them to the osx downloads on the mirror.\n\nOnce we release we just kick the jenkins job (which is not adapted yet) which signs the dmg - the sign process results in an dsa key hash which has to be added to the xml file (this is manual work - like when i update cydia repo).

I am using iPhone SE and standard WebView font size sometimes very difficult to read so I decided to contribute a bit to the project.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains from 2 major parts:\r\n1. View element that display quick settings for changing font size (it's small orange box on the right bottom corner with the arrow). I decided to create this instead of putting this to common settings for two reasons: the first one - I found it's not easy to understand philosophy of settings screen at all and the second is that's much more intuitive to change font size right in context of viewing a file.\r\n\r\n2. The second part is about actually changing the font and storing it between app launches. For storing data I used `[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]` but not sure if it's correct or not, because in some places app uses defaults for domain and in some - standard.\r\n\r\nFor handling changes I added observer for this property in user defaults.\r\n\r\nAnd for actually setting font size I used js string `document.body.style.fontSize = '%@';` in the `webView`. Sizes are provided in `%` to reflect user defined settings for the system fonts and default value is `100%`.\r\n\r\nBugs: I found that with some sizes update did not work (for example when font size changed from 400% to 420% then to 440% e.t.c.) but after closing the view and opening it again it uses correct size. I am not sure why it happens, maybe some MobileSafari specific.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nMaks", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-10-22T17:28:38", "merged_at": null, "comments": 4, "commits": 5, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

{"repo_fullname": "kickstarter/ios-oss", "user": "stephencelis", "title": "FunSwift2018: Reactive view models, simplified", "body": ":wave: Hey squad!\r\n\r\nI gave a talk yesterday at Functional Swift Conference in which I live-refactored a Kickstarter view model and controller. @ifbarrera attended and suggested that I open a PR with the result. We've been tweaking the reactive view model approach a bit the past coupla years and have been wanting to share.\r\n\r\nHere's what the end result looks like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stephencelis/ios-oss/blob/40cfb4da8afd23ea4d4cea637fbab161c238839d/Library/ViewModels/SignupViewModel.swift\r\n\r\nMain benefits we've seen:\r\n\r\n- Addresses the big boilerplate problem. Instead of containing view model logic using a bunch of different constructs (including multiple protocols, a class/struct, an initializer, a bunch of properties, a bunch of input functions that delegate directly to private properties), we can use a single construct: a single function. Half of the implementation boilerplate goes away and things become a bit easier to digest as a result\r\n\r\n- Another benefit of this style is that we get unused warnings for outputs not used in the view controller (one of which I found during the refactor).\r\n\r\nNote that this PR adds ReactiveCocoa as a dependency for less verbose binding in the view controller (avoids the extra target-action boilerplate). This isn't necessary, so take it or leave it, but after using RxSwift+RxCocoa on a project, it's been pretty nice to avoid the extra work and it made my talk go by a bit quicker.\r\n\r\nNot in this PR: updated tests! Some (but definitely not all) of the boilerplate lost in the main view model reappears in the tests since you need to manually create mutable properties in the test case, but it seems like a nicer trade-off to hide this boilerplate away in tests. For example:\r\n\r\n``` diff\r\n internal final class SignupViewModelTests: TestCase {\r\n-  fileprivate let vm: SignupViewModelType = SignupViewModel()\r\n+  fileprivate let emailChangedProperty = MutableProperty(\"\")\r\n+  fileprivate let emailTextFieldReturnProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let environmentLoggedInProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let nameChangedProperty = MutableProperty(\"\")\r\n+  fileprivate let nameTextFieldReturnProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let passwordChangedProperty = MutableProperty(\"\")\r\n+  fileprivate let passwordTextFieldReturnProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let signupButtonPressedProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let viewDidLoadProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let weeklyNewsletterChangedProperty = MutableProperty<Bool>(nil)\r\n+\r\n   fileprivate let emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder = TestObserver<(), NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let isSignupButtonEnabled = TestObserver<Bool, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let logIntoEnvironment = TestObserver<AccessTokenEnvelope, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder = TestObserver<(), NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder = TestObserver<(), NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let postNotification = TestObserver<Notification.Name, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let setWeeklyNewsletterState = TestObserver<Bool, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let showError = TestObserver<String, NoError>()\r\n\r\n   override func setUp() {\r\n     super.setUp()\r\n\r\n+    let (\r\n+      emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder,\r\n+      isSignupButtonEnabled,\r\n+      logIntoEnvironment,\r\n+      passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder,\r\n+      postNotification,\r\n+      nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder,\r\n+      setWeeklyNewsletterState,\r\n+      showError\r\n+    ) = signupViewModel(\r\n+      emailChanged: self.emailChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      emailTextFieldReturn: self.emailTextFieldChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      environmentLoggedIn: environmentLoggedInProperty.signal,\r\n+      nameChanged: self.nameTextFieldChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      nameTextFieldReturn: self.nameTextFieldReturnProperty.signal,\r\n+      passwordChanged: self.passwordTextFieldChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      passwordTextFieldReturn: self.passwordTextFieldReturnPropety.signal,\r\n+      signupButtonPressed: self.signupButtonPressedProperty.signal,\r\n+      viewDidLoad: viewDidLoadProperty.signal,\r\n+      weeklyNewsletterChanged: weeklyNewsletterChangedProperty.signal\r\n+    )\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n+    emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n-      .observe(self.emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.isSignupButtonEnabled.observe(self.isSignupButtonEnabled.observer)\r\n+    isSignupButtonEnabled.observe(self.isSignupButtonEnabled.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.logIntoEnvironment.observe(self.logIntoEnvironment.observer)\r\n+    logIntoEnvironment.observe(self.logIntoEnvironment.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observe(self.nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n+    nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observe(self.nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n+    passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n-      .observe(self.passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.postNotification.map { $0.name }.observe(self.postNotification.observer)\r\n+    postNotification.map { $0.name }.observe(self.postNotification.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.setWeeklyNewsletterState.observe(self.setWeeklyNewsletterState.observer)\r\n+    setWeeklyNewsletterState.observe(self.setWeeklyNewsletterState.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.showError.observe(self.showError.observer)\r\n+    showError.observe(self.showError.observer)\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible to get rid of some additional boilerplate by avoiding the destructuring (_e.g._, `let outputs = signupViewModel(\u2026)`), but then the compiler won't warn you when you forget to use an output, so in this case the trade-off seems worth it.\r\n\r\nWe've really enjoyed this approach, so we hope you do too!", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-12-02T17:45:08", "merged_at": null, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "mergeable": true, "review_comments": 5, "state": "open"}

{"repo_fullname": "kickstarter/ios-oss", "user": "stephencelis", "title": "FunSwift2018: Reactive view models, simplified", "body": ":wave: Hey squad!\r\n\r\nI gave a talk yesterday at Functional Swift Conference in which I live-refactored a Kickstarter view model and controller. @ifbarrera attended and suggested that I open a PR with the result. We've been tweaking the reactive view model approach a bit the past coupla years and have been wanting to share.\r\n\r\nHere's what the end result looks like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stephencelis/ios-oss/blob/40cfb4da8afd23ea4d4cea637fbab161c238839d/Library/ViewModels/SignupViewModel.swift\r\n\r\nMain benefits we've seen:\r\n\r\n- Addresses the big boilerplate problem. Instead of containing view model logic using a bunch of different constructs (including multiple protocols, a class/struct, an initializer, a bunch of properties, a bunch of input functions that delegate directly to private properties), we can use a single construct: a single function. Half of the implementation boilerplate goes away and things become a bit easier to digest as a result\r\n\r\n- Another benefit of this style is that we get unused warnings for outputs not used in the view controller (one of which I found during the refactor).\r\n\r\nNote that this PR adds ReactiveCocoa as a dependency for less verbose binding in the view controller (avoids the extra target-action boilerplate). This isn't necessary, so take it or leave it, but after using RxSwift+RxCocoa on a project, it's been pretty nice to avoid the extra work and it made my talk go by a bit quicker.\r\n\r\nNot in this PR: updated tests! Some (but definitely not all) of the boilerplate lost in the main view model reappears in the tests since you need to manually create mutable properties in the test case, but it seems like a nicer trade-off to hide this boilerplate away in tests. For example:\r\n\r\n``` diff\r\n internal final class SignupViewModelTests: TestCase {\r\n-  fileprivate let vm: SignupViewModelType = SignupViewModel()\r\n+  fileprivate let emailChangedProperty = MutableProperty(\"\")\r\n+  fileprivate let emailTextFieldReturnProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let environmentLoggedInProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let nameChangedProperty = MutableProperty(\"\")\r\n+  fileprivate let nameTextFieldReturnProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let passwordChangedProperty = MutableProperty(\"\")\r\n+  fileprivate let passwordTextFieldReturnProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let signupButtonPressedProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let viewDidLoadProperty = MutableProperty(())\r\n+  fileprivate let weeklyNewsletterChangedProperty = MutableProperty<Bool>(nil)\r\n+\r\n   fileprivate let emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder = TestObserver<(), NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let isSignupButtonEnabled = TestObserver<Bool, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let logIntoEnvironment = TestObserver<AccessTokenEnvelope, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder = TestObserver<(), NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder = TestObserver<(), NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let postNotification = TestObserver<Notification.Name, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let setWeeklyNewsletterState = TestObserver<Bool, NoError>()\r\n   fileprivate let showError = TestObserver<String, NoError>()\r\n\r\n   override func setUp() {\r\n     super.setUp()\r\n\r\n+    let (\r\n+      emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder,\r\n+      isSignupButtonEnabled,\r\n+      logIntoEnvironment,\r\n+      passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder,\r\n+      postNotification,\r\n+      nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder,\r\n+      setWeeklyNewsletterState,\r\n+      showError\r\n+    ) = signupViewModel(\r\n+      emailChanged: self.emailChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      emailTextFieldReturn: self.emailTextFieldChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      environmentLoggedIn: environmentLoggedInProperty.signal,\r\n+      nameChanged: self.nameTextFieldChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      nameTextFieldReturn: self.nameTextFieldReturnProperty.signal,\r\n+      passwordChanged: self.passwordTextFieldChangedProperty.signal,\r\n+      passwordTextFieldReturn: self.passwordTextFieldReturnPropety.signal,\r\n+      signupButtonPressed: self.signupButtonPressedProperty.signal,\r\n+      viewDidLoad: viewDidLoadProperty.signal,\r\n+      weeklyNewsletterChanged: weeklyNewsletterChangedProperty.signal\r\n+    )\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n+    emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n-      .observe(self.emailTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.isSignupButtonEnabled.observe(self.isSignupButtonEnabled.observer)\r\n+    isSignupButtonEnabled.observe(self.isSignupButtonEnabled.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.logIntoEnvironment.observe(self.logIntoEnvironment.observer)\r\n+    logIntoEnvironment.observe(self.logIntoEnvironment.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observe(self.nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n+    nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observe(self.nameTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n+    passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder\r\n-      .observe(self.passwordTextFieldBecomeFirstResponder.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.postNotification.map { $0.name }.observe(self.postNotification.observer)\r\n+    postNotification.map { $0.name }.observe(self.postNotification.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.setWeeklyNewsletterState.observe(self.setWeeklyNewsletterState.observer)\r\n+    setWeeklyNewsletterState.observe(self.setWeeklyNewsletterState.observer)\r\n-    self.vm.outputs.showError.observe(self.showError.observer)\r\n+    showError.observe(self.showError.observer)\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible to get rid of some additional boilerplate by avoiding the destructuring (_e.g._, `let outputs = signupViewModel(\u2026)`), but then the compiler won't warn you when you forget to use an output, so in this case the trade-off seems worth it.\r\n\r\nWe've really enjoyed this approach, so we hope you do too!", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-12-02T17:45:08", "merged_at": null, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "mergeable": true, "review_comments": 5, "state": "open"}

{"repo_fullname": "realm/realm-tasks", "user": "TimOliver", "title": "Authentication via CloudKit", "body": "This PR adds login via CloudKit as an alternative to the username / password login method of the RealmTasks app. It is still a WIP as it has not been properly tested with a local copy of the authentication server yet.\n\nIt works as follows:\n1. The app has been configured with CloudKit entitlements, and an App ID has been registered for it on Realm's iTunes Developer Account (I double-checked to make sure it's possible to later delete this ID after we're done!).\n2. A button labeled 'Connect with iCloud' has been placed on the Login View Controller.\n3. Tapping that button will send a request to iCloud, and will return the user's record ID. This is a unique string guaranteed to be the same for a user's iCloud account on each of their devices. Mine looked like: `_950637393581ea5577efb01fce48fcef`.\n4. Upon successfully receiving the token, it then uses the same logic as the username / password logic in that it is loaded into an HTTP request and sent to the Realm authentication server (But this will need to change when the Realm Sync Cocoa Binding API is fully decided)\n\nA couple of things I'm still researching:\n1. iOS and Mac apps are treated as discrete apps, so I'm still trying to work out how you can guarantee the CloudKit token would be the same on both RealmTasks macOS and iOS.\n2. Once the authentication server receives the key, what steps should be taken to verify that it is a valid key on the server's end. I'm still looking through CloudKit's REST API to see what endpoints are available to external servers for this.\n3. We probably need to be very careful how we advertise this authentication method publicly. We need to make sure it is obvious that the extent of how much we're using iCloud is to _only_ get a unique identity representing the user, and that everything else is managed by Realm (Obviously we need to be careful about Apple branding and the iCloud logo too)\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/429119/17170405/633cd5e4-541e-11e6-8808-115a8e9caf7e.png\" width=\"350\" />\n", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2016-07-27T09:28:34", "merged_at": null, "comments": 21, "commits": 23, "mergeable": null, "review_comments": 1, "state": "open"}

The `run_keybase` kills all the Keybase processes and starts them up again, so if Keybase is running it restarts it.\r\n\r\nWhen I click the Keybase shortcut, I know Keybase is already running in the background and I'd expect it to just show the GUI and not restart Keybase. However with the current `keybase.desktop` shortcut on Linux, when you click on the shortcut, it runs `run_keybase`. Because this command involves killing all Keybase processes, it can be problematic and surprising, as I've found on one occasion.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is, what if you're uploading something to KBFS? If you've moved the files to KBFS, and then say someone's sent you a message on Keybase, and you go to click the shortcut in the app launcher to see it, Keybase will restart and the files you were uploading will be lost. This is especially a problem because some distros are either planning to or already have removed the systray. I recently upgraded to elementary OS Juno and they've already done this, so the only way I can open Keybase in a user friendly way is to click on the launcher.\r\n\r\nThe PR basically changes the launcher to point to the Keybase GUI executable instead. It now just brings up the Electron UI. If the Keybase GUI is already up, it does nothing. I don't think this would create any problems, unless there are any circumstances where the Keybase GUI executable won't get installed to `/opt/keybase/Keybase`. As a bonus, showing the GUI is slightly quicker than it was previously.\r\n\r\n`run_keybase` is still there in the form of a \"Restart\" action (which more accurately represents what it does) which (at least on my distro) shows as an option when you right click the icon.\r\n\r\nThank you for Keybase, by the way!", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-10-19T12:57:35", "merged_at": null, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "mergeable": null, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

{"repo_fullname": "keybase/client", "user": "cjb", "title": "Chat: Handle the new \"duplicate\" message error type, by not displaying it", "body": "@keybase/react-hackers CC @chrisnojima @mmaxim \r\n\r\nIf we get a message with error type \"duplicate\". it means it was rejected by Gregor as a duplicate attempted send.  Normally we display errors for failed messages and offer to retry them, but that's not appropriate here -- we don't want to display anything at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR seems to work, but I don't much like the way it turned out.  We can learn of \"duplicate\" error messages in three different ways:\r\n\r\n1. They can be relayed to us from the outbox as part of a GetThread call, in which case we need to not render them at all.\r\n\r\n2. Race outcome 1: we can send a message, display it in pending state in the GUI, and then get an IncomingMessage notification telling us about the duplicate failure, in which case we need to delete it from the GUI after it's already been rendered.\r\n\r\n3. Race outcome 2: we can send a message, but due to a race between sagas and RPCs that RPCs win, we learn of the message's duplicate failure before we finish thinking we've sent a message.  In this case we need to store away the fact that we've been told of a failure, and the fact that it's this special kind of failure, and then when we would normally render the message as pending in the GUI we decide not to.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I went with:\r\n\r\n1. When we unbox a message with this duplicate error, we store it as a messageKind of 'errorInvisible' instead of  'outboxText'.  We have to store some kind of message, because it's an invariant in all of our code that an _unboxedToMessage() call produces a Message object for the store in every case.\r\n\r\n2. When we're rendering a thread, we now render these 'errorInvisible' messages an an empty `<Box />`.\r\n\r\n3. When we get an IncomingMessage telling us about a failure (Race outcome 1), we update the Message object in the store to have the messageKind updated to `errorInvisible` at that point, and it's rendered away as it would be in the first case.\r\n\r\n4. When we get an IncomingMessage telling us about a failure we haven't rendered yet (Race outcome 2), we just don't add anything at all in the store.\r\n\r\nThis is complicated enough that I'm not confident the code's going to be correct, and in general debugging these errors and races in transitioning messages from pending -> sent -> deleted is causing us a lot of hassle, so I don't feel good about merging this PR yet.  We might be better just asking for CORE help to take care of this case.  Or, we could try to refactor our code to eliminate this RPC<->sagas race, which I think would make us feel happier about adding new edge cases to this code.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-07-25T00:58:20", "merged_at": null, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "mergeable": null, "review_comments": 1, "state": "open"}

This is my initial attempt at implementing `Asset.fromUri`, thereby allowing remote uri fonts to be loaded to the app.\r\n\r\n# How\r\n\r\nThis contains a naive implementation for `fromUri`. It is also not possible to know the md5 hash of the file beforehand, like the way we know with other normal type assets. So I've added a constructor argument for Asset called `ignoreHashCheck` which lets us ignore hash check for remote uri assets.\r\n\r\nThe implementation in this PR makes remote font loading for my specific use case, but if someone has suggestion for extending this to more generic use cases, please let me know.\r\n\r\n**Caveat:** It is not possible to know the md5 hash of files beforehand, so this PR ignores the hash check. This also means that newer version of files would not be re-downloaded if the file already exists in cache directory.\r\n\r\nThe name of the file that the remote file gets downloaded to is the base64 encoded value of the uri itself. This ensures that different uri have different their own unique local file name and wouldn't conflict. Is there a better way to do this?\r\n\r\nAlso, prettier auto-formatted a bunch of other lines in the Asset file that are not related to the change.

A couple of notes:\r\n\r\nWe had previously agreed upon using the java `Promise.reject` method with the code, message, and native exception params. However, there are some cases where we don't actually have a native exception -- in those cases, should we use the method with just the code and message parameters? We lose the ability to get a native stack trace in that case.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the API we discussed has another small complication. On Android there are two separate system settings for the brightness value in manual and automatic mode, and they are completely independent. While it is possible to **read** the automatic brightness value using the `screen_auto_brightness_adj` constant, the OS blocks any attempt to **write** this value.\r\n\r\nI ended up having `getSystemBrightnessAsync` get the automatic value if automatic brightness is turned on, since I think it makes sense to just return the actual brightness value of the phone at the moment. We could instead pass in a parameter to determine whether to read the manual or automatic value, but I really can't think of a use case where you would want to read the value you aren't using.\r\n\r\nThere are three things you cannot do with this PR's API that you would be able to with a fully native app:\r\n1. Write to the manual system brightness value while staying on automatic brightness\r\n2. Read the value of manual system brightness while using automatic brightness, or vice versa\r\n3. Read whether or not the app is using the system brightness (or if it's overridden), since `getBrightnessAsync` falls back to `getSystemBrightnessAsync` in the case of `-1`.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any reasonable use cases that require any of these three things, but happy to discuss/rethink.\r\n\r\nI'll follow up soon with a PR in universe for docs & internal docs (audit process).", "changed_files": 67, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-10-12T01:46:28", "merged_at": null, "comments": 3, "commits": 9, "mergeable": null, "review_comments": 17, "state": "open"}

I didn't want to modify the code in Ultrawave, so I used this approach with the wrappers.\r\n\r\nThis means there is quite a few changed files.. please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you are confused by the changes during review and if it is not obvious why I moved some parts of the code around.\r\n\r\n### Why not another way?\r\nAfter I implemented all of this, I am asking myself if it is really necessary. It might be sufficient to have just the 60r/60s leaky bucket and not the 3r/1s.\r\n\r\n_Update_: I got \"better\" results _with_ the 3r/1s leaky bucket. And by better I mean more stable. It might take a few milliseconds more in the best case scenario, but I ran into several 429 responses from the server and the 60/60 leaky bucket forced me into _long_ (> 40s) delays. I think that the 3r/1s can help us with a steady rate of pushing entities (avoid 429s because of big bursts of requests). I think we should use this implementation and not resort to 60/60 only.\r\n\r\n### Side effects\r\n~Pull sync is now slower. The main reason is because the requests are now made in a \"random\" order instead of trying to preserve. It shouldn't be hard to start the pull requests in \"waves\".~ _I changed the behavior so we will now send GET requests in waves of 3 requests._\r\n\r\n### Review hints\r\n\r\n1. Check the `IRequestSender` interface and the basic `RequestSender` class and related tests. These changes are basically just moving old code from the `FetchAllSinceState` to this new class.\r\n2. Check the `RateLimitingAwareRequestSender` class and the unit tests. This class uses the leaky bucket to create an observable which delays until there is a free slot (recursively in case multiple parallel requests are trying to acquire a slot - I tried using a `while` loop but it didn't work).\r\n3.

This eliminates the need for the Communications.web method to direct the user outside of the application to google maps (deemed not very useful/interesting). Subsequently, we pass down the search query to the search screen from the navigation object's params to display the search term to the user in the RNSearchBar and MNSearchBar components. Rather than TabNavigator, an additional shared StackNavigator route was needed in order to allow for the passing of the params (upgrading the React-Navigation dependency to the current version would eliminate this need, however, that refactor would fall well outside the scope of this issue). You will note the new shared route titled 'SearchUsersByLocation' in the routes.js file. Navigating to this feature in this way also gives the user the added benefit of having a back arrow to return to the entity from which the location was derived.\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT MODIFY BELOW THIS LINE -->\r\n<!-- ----------------------------- -->\r\n<!-- GITPOINT_PR -->\r\n", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-05-10T18:42:38", "merged_at": null, "comments": 2, "commits": 6, "mergeable": null, "review_comments": 7, "state": "open"}

The buffer contains an NSTextStorage (NSMutableAttributedString subclass) that the `TerminalTextView` reads from. \r\n\r\nThe buffer is responsible for adding new text that comes in to the proper position in the text storage. It uses the `TerminalCursor` (referred to as the \"cursor\") to keep track of where it needs to insert new text.\r\n\r\n## Parsing\r\nThe buffer is now the Parser's delegate, and receives events from the Parser, some of which are:\r\n- Newline found (`\\n`)\r\n- Carriage return found (`\\r`)\r\n- Attributed text found\r\n\r\nDepending on what the Parser sends, the buffer will update the cursor's position and/or modify the text storage.\r\n\r\n## Cursor\r\nThe cursor (different than the UITextView's cursor), keeps track of a position within the text storage. It's only valid for a single text storage. It has a readable x,y coordinate, as well as an offset (current distance from the beginning of the storage).\r\n\r\nThe cursor contains mutating methods that adjust its state, and is not able to be modified except through those methods. Every time the x, y, or offset change, it makes sure to keep the other values in sync.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nIn this example, I'll demonstrate what happens when a carriage return is received while parsing.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, the storage contains a 2-line string, and the cursor is right after the last character of the first word:\r\n```\r\ntext storage = \"iPad: \\nhello world\"\r\ncursor = { x = 5, y = 1, offset = 12 }\r\n```\r\nNow, when a carriage return is received, the `parserDidReceiveCarriageReturn(_:)` method is called by the `Parser`. After this is handled, here is the state:\r\n```\r\ntext storage = \"iPad: \\nhello world\"\r\ncursor = { x = 0, y = 1, offset = 7 }\r\n```\r\nNow, if more text comes in from the parser - \"bonjour\", here is the end state:\r\n```\r\ntext storage = \"iPad: \\nbonjourorld\"\r\ncursor = { x = 7, y = 1, offset = 14 }\r\n```", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-02-11T01:47:19", "merged_at": null, "comments": 12, "commits": 21, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 3, "state": "open"}

You can also use the `/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */` control comment to enable autoplacement directly in your CSS.\n\nIn order to use the new autoplacement feature, you **must define both rows and columns** when declaring the grid template.\n\n```css\n/* Input CSS */\n\n/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */\n\n.autoplacement-example {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n    grid-template-rows: auto auto;\n    grid-gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n```css\n/* Output CSS */\n\n/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */\n\n.autoplacement-example {\n  display: -ms-grid;\n  display: grid;\n  -ms-grid-columns: 1fr 20px 1fr;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n  -ms-grid-rows: auto 20px auto;\n  grid-template-rows: auto auto;\n  grid-gap: 20px;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(1) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 1;\n  -ms-grid-column: 1;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(2) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 1;\n  -ms-grid-column: 3;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(3) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 3;\n  -ms-grid-column: 1;\n}\n\n.autoplacement-example > *:nth-child(4) {\n  -ms-grid-row: 3;\n  -ms-grid-column: 3;\n}\n```\n\nAutoplacement support in Autoprefixer is currently very limited in what it can do. Please read the  [Grid Autoplacement support in IE ](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer#grid-autoplacement-support-in-ie) section before using this new feature.\n\nThanks to [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://renovatebot.com/gh/bogdan0083) for implementing the new feature, [@&#8203;Dan503](https://renovatebot.com/gh/Dan503) for documenting it, and [@&#8203;evandiamond](https://renovatebot.com/gh/evandiamond) for coming up with the initial idea.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   Remove some unnecessary warnings for Grid (by [@&#8203;fanich37](https://renovatebot.com/gh/fanich37)).\n\n### [`v9.3.1`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;931)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.3.0...9.3.1)\n\n-   Fix Grid prefixes with `repeat()` value (by Bogdan Dolin).\n\n### [`v9.3.0`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/releases/9.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.2.1...9.3.0)\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/47355871-8df3cd00-d690-11e8-8ca3-5574d0104ff3.png\" alt=\"Coat of Arms of Oklahoma\" width=\"200\" height=\"202\" align=\"right\">\n\nAutoprefixer 9.3 brings `place-self` support for Grid Layout\n\n#### `place-self`\n\n[@&#8203;Dan503](https://renovatebot.com/gh/Dan503) and [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://renovatebot.com/gh/bogdan0083) [found](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1143) a way to impement support for another Grid property\n\n```css\n.grid > .center {\n  place-self: center;\n}\n```\n\n```css\n.grid > .center {\n  -ms-grid-row-align: center;\n  -ms-grid-column-align: center;\n  place-self: center;\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n[@&#8203;Dan503](https://renovatebot.com/gh/Dan503) and [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://renovatebot.com/gh/bogdan0083) also [detected and fixed](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/1146) issue with Grid row/column span inheritance.\n\n### [`v9.2.1`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;921)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.2.0...9.2.1)\n\n-   Fix broken AST.\n\n### [`v9.2.0`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/releases/9.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.1.5...9.2.0)\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19343/46919884-e271bb00-cfb3-11e8-8473-6c30fcfc5207.png\" alt=\"Coat of Arms of Omsk\" width=\"240\" height=\"204\" align=\"right\" />\n\nAutoprefixer 9.2 brings many new improvements for `-ms-` prefixes for\u00a0Grid\u00a0Layout.\n\n#### New Ways to Enable/Disable Grid Layout\n\nIn previous versions, you had needed to pass `grid: true` to enable prefixes for Grid Layout. But not all users have access to Autoprefixer options. CodePen, Create Reat App or Angular CLI doesn\u2019t\u00a0allow you to\u00a0do\u00a0it.\n\nIn Autoprefixer 9.2 [@&#8203;fanich37](https://renovatebot.com/gh/fanich37) added special control comments:\n\n```css\n/* autoprefixer grid: on */\n.grid {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-gap: 33px;\n    grid-template:\n        \"head head  head\" 1fr\n        \"nav  main  main\" minmax(100px, 1fr)\n        \"nav  foot  foot\" 2fr /\n        1fr   100px 1fr;\n}\n\n.non-ie .grid {\n    /* autoprefixer grid: off */\n    \u2026\n}\n```\n\nAutoprefixer doesn\u2019t support Grid properties and values with `auto`. In 9.2 it will ignore whole `@supports` content if it contains these Grid properties:\n\n```css\n@&#8203;supports (grid-auto-rows: 100px) {\n    /* Autoprefixer will not show Grid warnings and will not add prefixes here */\n}\n```\n\n#### Smarter `grid-area`\n\nAutoprefixer supports `grid-template` even if it was not in IE Grid spec.\n\nBut in 9.2 [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://renovatebot.com/gh/bogdan0083) really improve it according to [@&#8203;Dan503](https://renovatebot.com/gh/Dan503) idea. Now Autoprefixer supports even overriding `grid-template`.\n\n```css\n/* autoprefixer grid: on */\n.grid {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template:\n        \"nav  main\" minmax(100px, 1fr)\n        \"nav  foot\" 2fr /\n        100px 1fr;\n}\n\n.grid.no-menu {\n    grid-template:\n        \"main\" minmax(100px, 1fr)\n        \"foot\" 2fr\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n-   Improve Grid warnings (by [@&#8203;Dan503](https://renovatebot.com/gh/Dan503) and [@&#8203;bogdan0083](https://renovatebot.com/gh/bogdan0083))\n-   Improve docs (by [@&#8203;JoshuaHall](https://renovatebot.com/gh/JoshuaHall), [@&#8203;Drarok](https://renovatebot.com/gh/Drarok), [@&#8203;revelt](https://renovatebot.com/gh/revelt), and [@&#8203;janczer](https://renovatebot.com/gh/janczer)).\n\n### [`v9.1.5`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;915)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.1.4...9.1.5)\n\n-   Remove `@babel/register` from dependencies.\n\n### [`v9.1.4`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;914)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.1.3...9.1.4)\n\n-   Use Babel 7.\n\n### [`v9.1.3`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;913)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.1.2...9.1.3)\n\n-   Sort properties in `autoprefixer --info` alphabetically.\n-   Fix old Firefox gradient prefix.\n\n### [`v9.1.2`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;912)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.1.1...9.1.2)\n\n-   Fix `autoprefixer --info` in new Node.js.\n\n### [`v9.1.1`](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;911)\n\n[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/postcss/autoprefixer/compare/9.1.0...9.1.1)\n\n-   Retain `grid-gap` through `@media` (by Bogdan Dolin).\n-   Fix `grid-template` and  `@media` (by Bogdan Dolin).\n-   Fix Grid areas searching error (by Bogdan Dolin).\n-   Fix `span X` Grid prefix (by Bogdan Dolin).\n-   Fix docs (by Eduard Kyvenko).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Renovate configuration\n\n:date: **Schedule**: \"after 10pm every weekday,before 5am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone Europe/Paris.\n\n:vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
