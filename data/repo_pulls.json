I\u2019m sending this refactoring suggestion in this PR.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to integrate these changes? If that is not the case, could you explain why this PR is not useful?

In the process I changed the `FullImageViewController` attachment bar animation to slide up/down from the bottom instead of dissolving in/out.\r\n* Add `FullscreenVideoViewController` to wrap `MPMoviePlayerVideoController` and provide similar transition zoom animations using a custom UIViewController transition animator.\r\n* Some related code cleanup\r\n\r\nThe commit messages provide some detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n* This should also fix Issue #1293. It does so by setting `self.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext` on the new view controller so the message view controller doesn't get torn down in the background. It's not ideal because the video controller is opaque, but the complexity of the alternative seemed worse. I saw Pull #1538, but in my testing that method would not really work because [the if block that scrolls to the bottom in `viewWillAppear`](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS/blob/0cd71b3b2ea93e4c3ad543108ea19214b5ab8ee6/Signal/src/ViewControllers/MessagesViewController.m#L550) does not do anything, I think because of `resetContentAndLayout` below. Further, in this case you would want to return to a precise scroll offset, not just ensure an index path is showing.\r\n* Before presenting `FullImageViewController` and `FullscreenVideoViewController` the keyboard needs to be dismissed so that the zoom out animation lines up.\r\n* Since multiple views in `FullImageViewController` were set to have a semi-transparent black background the resulting alpha level was not `kBackgroundAlpha` but something higher based on whatever blending iOS is using. I changed it so that only one view has a background color set and upped the constant to be closer to matching the current effective value.\r\n* As in the current version the zoom animations can potentially show up over the message controller navigation bar. My opinion is that the *best* solution is to take after Message.app and leave the navigation bar intact on zoom in instead of overlaying over the entire screen. This likely requires a custom movie player view instead of using `MPMoviePlayerController`.\r\n* I did take a shot at unifying the zoom animation code between `FullImageViewController` and `FullscreenVideoViewController`. Unfortunately given the wrangling required to use `MPMoviePlayerViewControler` I ended up with more complicated to share code. It probably would make sense to merge the two if `MPMoviePlayerViewControler` were ditched in favor of a custom player view controller. (And, in my opinion, going custom feels like a natural next step given a) `MPMoviePlayerViewControler` is deprecated and the new `AVPlayerViewController` is not as well suited in this context and b) it would make it possible to unify the UI with the image version and add the same share button.)\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\nI tested on a few devices and iOS 8, 9 and 10. I did my best to initiate the zooms from different scroll positions and keyboard states. Since I change the `MPMoviePlayerViewController` usage to not use its fullscreen mode (though it does use the fullscreen controls) I did testing that the video view is not dismissed prematurely and correctly dismissed for all relevant user interactions. \r\n", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-04-22T19:17:18", "merged_at": null, "comments": 0, "commits": 4, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

Thing is iRate performs first check to prompt during object creation and that is too early to set \u201eprevent\u201d flag. Way out of it is if app is being launched by remote notification, do not initialiseze iRate object. Testing was quite easy as I have setup iRate rules to fire everytime I open app and I have noticed that even if i explicitly set delegate method iRateShouldPromptForRating to NO, I still got first rating prompt during app launch.

{"repo_fullname": "mozilla-mobile/focus-ios", "user": "tgt", "title": "Improves contrast of action sheets when accessibility features enabled.", "body": "The Increase Contrast and Reduce Transparency accessibility features should improve accessibility. However, before this change enabling them caused the background of action sheets to become medium grey and the text to become a slightly lighter grey, which made the text hard to read. This prevents the problem by avoiding the use of a blur effect view when Reduce Transparency is enabled and using white text when Increase Contrast is enabled to prevent it from being darkened.\r\n\r\nThere're a few comments in the code where I think something better should be done, but I'm not sure of the best way.\r\n\r\n1. Where the TableViewBackgroundColor is defined I've written:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// It'd be better to compute this colour by blending Ink90 with grey to emulate the layering\r\n// done when reduce transparency is disabled\r\nreturn UIColor(rgb: 0x454558)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Where the darkerSystemColorsStatusDidChangeNotification observer is defined I've written:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// Is there a better way to have the text redrawn to make sure contrast isn't affected?\r\nself.tableView.reloadData()\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Where PhotonActionSheet.tintColor is defined I've changed to a computed property that returns white when  the user has enabled Increase Contrast. This prevents the text colour from being darkened when the setting is enabled. There may be a way to simply prevent a label from being affected by Increase Contrast, but I'm not aware of it.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// Light grey is darkened, which reduces contrast on a dark background,\r\n// so use white instead when the user has enabled the Increase Contrast\r\n// accessibility setting\r\nif UIAccessibility.isDarkerSystemColorsEnabled {\r\n    return UIConstants.Photon.White100\r\n} else {\r\n    return UIConstants.Photon.Grey10\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've attached several images showing the previous problems and how things look after my changes:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"original\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660282-9b2c2280-db8e-11e8-8f03-720fbb62c5bb.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"increase contrast\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660287-9ebfa980-db8e-11e8-978c-cb039a301ac8.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"reduce transparency\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660293-a0896d00-db8e-11e8-8b90-f236010201b8.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"reduce transparency and increase contrast\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660300-a2ebc700-db8e-11e8-9764-0ad408e61beb.png\">\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"reduce transparency and increase contrast after code changes\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472609/47660310-a54e2100-db8e-11e8-9758-4c5502bd6b24.png\">\r\n", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-10-29T15:31:15", "merged_at": null, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

This pull request has a lot of stuff in it, so let me go over it:\r\n\r\n* Uses SFSafariViewController wherever HNWebViewController was used. Not much to say here since it was mostly a drop-in replacement.\r\n* Support of 3D Touch wherever it seems appropriate\u2013the link in the feed, the comments button in the feed, and the link in the header in the comments view.\r\n* Replace an en dash that was bothering me with a minus sign (which has the same width as a plus sign).\r\n\r\nAlso, there's a slightly controversial change of collapsing comments by tapping on them. This might not be what you want, so I'm fine with dropping it, but my rationale behind it was that there was no action performed by tapping on cells anyways so why not?\r\n\r\nFinally, this pull request has *full* iOS 11 support. In particular, it fixes a couple of legacy issues and adapts the new large titles, integrated `UISearchController`/`UIRefreshControl`, etc. Plus there's a couple of fixes for warnings and whatnot. I know there are other pull requests for a subset of the things in mine, but they're not quite there. In particular, #19 doesn't actually fix the comment layout views, which fly off the screen, #22 uses private API to turn the search bar white and keeps a separate results controller, which I think introduces complexity.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that this pull request doesn't actually merge cleanly; this was done on purpose. I'm requesting that if you merge this, you do so as-is. The reason for this is that some recent commits have introduced some changes that aren't really necessary (especially with regards to updated Cocoapods), and I've gone through and manually picked out the useful bits. Of course, this makes the pull request seem behind your master branch, but Cocoapods should be up to date.\r\n", "changed_files": 127, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2018-01-18T11:47:22", "merged_at": null, "comments": 1, "commits": 7, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

Not sure it's totally ready to be merged - I'm still not that comfortable with ObjC, so some code review would be required, and there are some cosmetic issues that could probably be fixed.\n\nThis adds support for displaying one time passwords, as requested in issue #225, using the KeeOTP format (I believe!) for data. e.g.\n\n```\nkey=PEHMPSDNLXIOG65U&step=30&size=6\n```\n\nOnly `key` is required, step defaults to 30 and size to 6.  This data can be in the notes (for kdb and kdbx files) or in a string field (kdbx only).  In the notes, it has to be prefixed with `otp:`, and the string field name has to be `otp`.  A QR code for the above key can be found on [this page](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2011/07/google-totp-two-factor-authentication-for-php/) if you want to compare the values to another OTP generator.\n\nI branched [aerogear-otp-ios](https://github.com/markhewett/aerogear-otp-ios) to add support for the things I needed and added that as a submodule (hopefully that part is correct, I'm not comfortable with Git either!).\n\nHere's what it looks like in a kdb file:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 39 03 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324345/2bfdd536-7c9f-11e4-9318-636c11c34a45.png)\n\nHere's the same entry when the OTP is about to expire:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 39 24 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324351/3e6f4c22-7c9f-11e4-94f5-c2bbc06f1340.png)\n\nHere's what it looks like in a kdbx file:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 40 01 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324357/4d521e7c-7c9f-11e4-84e6-704b1096ed78.png)\n\nAs you can see, the alignment of the \"clock\" icon is a bit off, but I'm not sure how to fix that.\n\nI did add a new button in the browser to paste the OTP, but it needs a new icon, instead of the duplicate asterisk:\n![screen shot 2014-12-05 at 4 40 17 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1621581/5324363/5fb8acac-7c9f-11e4-9b92-16ec520cd10c.png)\n\nLet me know what you think - what improvements need to be made, or if you don't want to add this, etc.\n", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2014-12-05T22:58:10", "merged_at": null, "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

I also changed the NSError type to Error in URLSessionDownloadTask. \r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed a bug (see screenshot) where the optional values of locality, postalCode, adminArea, and country were never actually getting unwrapped.

I know the code is a pile of garbage as-is, but it works for testing and the improvement is substantial. As this change introduces no new dependecies (libjpeg-turbo is already a hard dependecy of Kodi, as I see it) and does not introduce new features (but improves the performance of an existing feature), I opted not to implement it as an addon.

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "AlwinEsch", "title": "[addons] remove cpluff", "body": "## Description\r\nThis request removes the use of \"cpluff\" in Kodi.\r\n\r\n**Why should be cpluff removed:**\r\ncpluff was designed to run a complete addon management. This includes not only loading the addon data, but also using and running these addons.\r\n\r\nKodi has only used the loading of addon.xml. This can also be done quite easily by yourself.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the performance of cpluff is rather bad and Kodi must always retry the data stored in it to create its matching data structure. Therefore, the data passes through twice in the system, once in cpluff and once in Kodi.\r\n\r\nAlso, cpluff does not allow to easily work together multiple addon types in an addon itself, see Binary addons. There is only information related to the respective addon type and no other type in it.\r\n\r\n**What does this:**\r\nIt searches the addons stored in the system or reads the data given by the repository and then creates it from the found xml file. Or by using [CAddonInfoBuilder::CFromDB](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-d468e80a368d09a27acf00bab3edf35fR29) from database.\r\n\r\nFor local addons, the information created with [CAddonInfoBuilder::Generate](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-11ac4eb50187a8acb45199c341852086R51) is then stored in the manager (instead of in cpluff). In the case of a request, the associated CAddonInfo will then be issued.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a change, this list will be replaced or an entry removed (as before). Because these are given as shared memory, conflicts are ruled out if used elsewhere (similar to the previous ones where the classes were copied instead).\r\n\r\n**What changed here:**\r\nThis contains only the minimal changes and the access to the AddonManager remains as before.\r\n\r\nOnly the \"FromExtension\" is removed at the respective addon classes and replaced with a new path.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CAddonInfo is no longer passed with a static address but with a shared pointer because the CAddonInfo is already stored in the AddonManager and must remain there.\r\n\r\nThis is another try. But definitely something has to be done because with cpluff, Kodi comes to its limits and the previous code (also by me for advanced abilities) is very disgusted.\r\n\r\nPlease do not come back with \"no, no\", if it does not fit, help me or bring a good one yourself.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nTo finally make the addon system more extensible and secure\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- [X] Test code system added\r\n- [ ] Test with mostly all available addons\r\n- [ ] Test automatic updates\r\n- [x] Test uninstall / update to becomes not more bad\r\n- [ ] Test with bad addon.xml's\r\n- [ ] Test on all OS's (related e.g. to binary download on Windows)\r\n- [x] Confirm current binary addon system works normal\r\n- [X] Repository addon install over ZIP Ok (still need Kodi restart like before, to download included addons)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

This are:\r\n1. Addon class \"CPresentShader\"\r\n    - It allow addon to use Kodi's basic predefined shaders from CRenderSystemGL or CRenderSystemGLES\r\n    - This is then the most easiest way for a addon to get shader. Tested on asteroids screensaver and works good\r\n2. Addon class \"CShader\" and \"CShaderProgram\"\r\n    - This allow the use of more complex shaders where load becomes handled from Kodi. This makes it on addon side more easy to handle differences between different OS's and GL Versions.\r\n    - Before was for more complex OpenGL shading a extra code on addons needed to handle this load.\r\n    - This support the load of Kodi's own shaders or own from addon where it give his folder to Kodi\r\n    - Test of them works good.\r\n3. Addon class \"CMatrix\"\r\n    - It has now a interface for the Matrix Processing on OpenGL\r\n    - This allow the for performance optimized code to use on addon\r\n4. Addon class \"CMatrixStack\"\r\n    - This is a special stack handler, over static functions there can the addon use the Matrix Stack's from Kodi for him.\r\n    - Further can it create the class by self new who make a own stack on addon.\r\n    - This code is currently not tested.\r\n\r\n**Just as an example of an idea, not sure if it's acceptable.

For UDP streams, it is set to false. But this is later overwritten by:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// iformat is NULL because it is a udp stream and we don\u2019t have the format type in advance\r\nelse if (!iformat || (strcmp(iformat->name, \u201cmpegts\u201d) != 0))\r\n{\r\nm_streaminfo = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe must be careful.\r\n\r\n* If we completely disable the streaminfo request, video is not rendered at all.\r\n* Setting the timeout to a hundred milliseconds works, but may not be safe.

This value has been chosen because it is used in ffmpeg and this value is even cited as being set as such to fix slow IPTV channel changes for Kodi. \r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThis has been included in OSMC since early January on Kodi Krypton without reports of issues.\r\nIt has also been included with our Kodi Leia test builds, but this does attract fewer users. \r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

I was thinking about adding an externals folder but with curl maybe ending up being the only wrapper it made little sense.\r\n\r\ng_curlInterface and it's caching of connections is gone to avoid global state management that at best provides a negligible performance increase.\r\n\r\nA very simple class `CCurlGlobalInit` is added that's only job is to init/deinit curl globally and set up locks for static linking.\r\n\r\n### Doubt ###\r\nAfter I started on this I started doubting myself a bit so curious about others thoughts on this. Same goal can probably be achieved with a somewhat redesigned `CCurlFile`.\r\n\r\nMaybe use `std::error_condition` instead of `std::error_code` as I learned that technically std::error_code is for system errors and std::error_condition is for \"other\" errors.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your change in detail -->\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

I open the PR because of #12225 and because I need input on how to handle configuring the list of allowed domains. I also haven't done much testing yet because I don't have a client ready to hand.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nIn general browsers don't allow performing POST requests from one domain to another due to security reasons. This however can stop clients from interacting with Kodi. The solution for this is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which adds additional HTTP headers to the request and responses indicating whether CORS is supported or not.\r\nDue to this being a potential security issue (if not properly configured) CORS is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled by the user in the settings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the proper thing to do would be to ask the user to configure the list of domains which should be allowed to use CORS. This is however very technical and I'm not sure how best to integrate this into the user interface which is why I haven't done it yet. Right now when CORS is enabled the webserver accepts cross domain requests from any domain.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-06-06T07:15:39", "merged_at": null, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "mergeable": true, "review_comments": 2, "state": "open"}

Made existing code more readable, inspired by [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133)\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nWhenever I delete a movie on my NAS, a video library clean on Kodi removes not only the movie from the database, but also the entire path (folder and its movies)! \r\n\r\nI am using a movie structure like this:\r\nSourceVideoFolder (\"Movies\")\r\n---QualityFolder (like \"HD\", \"SD\", \"4k\" etc.)\r\n------YearFolder (like \"1900-1999\", \"2000-2010\" etc)\r\n---------Movies\r\n\r\nThis happens, because in function CleanMediaType() the pathsDeleteDecisions wrongly got only the bool \"del\" (corresponds if the missing movie should be deleted), instead of also checking if the folder still exists. The path shouldn't get deleted if it exists.\r\n\r\nIn [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133) anaconda also ran into a similar issue, as mentioned in the comments (on Oct 25, 2015), but they didn't solve the issue.

It should compile on Android but I didn't runtime test it. OSX/iOS is completely untested.

Furthermore it supports named loggers which should make logging in the code much easier and also make the log file easier to read because every class/instance follows the same guidelines (right now every class logs their class name differently or not at all). As an example I've implemented a named logger for the `CWebServer` class in 9ed2953de94f50cc578cfad1af18b873c33817e7.\r\n\r\nUsing templates I also managed to get rid of the difference between `Log` and `LogW` which makes the interface of `CLog` easier to use.\r\n\r\nI had to fix some log messages (all collected in 6f1e4a6fb0e29fb693270335f1084cb36d41a9b6) because they didn't match in type and therefore weren't type safe.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nLocal testing on windows.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n- [ ] better solution for `gai_strerror()` as char/wchar_t\r\n- [ ] fix pkgconfig version\r\n- [ ] fixed width for thread id and log level\r\n- [ ] find a solution for `LOGINFO` vs. `LOGNOTICE`\r\n- [x] add `TARGET_WIN10` defines\r\n- [x] get rid of unnecessary trailing newlines in log messages\r\n- [x] fix crash in `CDVDDemuxClient`", "changed_files": 135, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-03-09T12:51:56", "merged_at": null, "comments": 42, "commits": 6, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 10, "state": "open"}

This will probably replace our current patches in LibreELEC regardless of if they are accepted here or not. If this isn't something that we want in Kodi then it would still be nice to get some comments about the code quality (I'm no c++ dev). \r\n\r\nThis allows running systemd services that are inside the add-on. On LibreELEC because we use Kodi's add-on system as the package manager. We provide binary add-ons that can contain services (like tvheadend, docker, etc). These services are started via systemd service files. We previously maintained an ugly patch to start these services. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/aadeef8bdff40ae19cb61f1206ff30ebbaebb8bb and [here](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv/blob/master/packages/mediacenter/kodi/scripts/systemd-addon-wrapper)\r\n\r\nI wanted to make something that is cleaner and using proper methods. Since Kodi has a DBus method already it was rather simple to use that. So when add-ons are enabled/disabled dbus calls the systemd manager to enable/disable and start/stop service units.\r\n\r\nThe second commit extends this to add timedated support to allow setting the host OS timezone from within kodi. LibreELEC again maintained a patch for this. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/fb5c7a43280419bfa464b945da3b46f74782f0ad\r\n\r\nI decided to only depend on dbus because that's what is done in [LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/powermanagement/linux/LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp) as it doesn't look for systemd or upower.\r\n\r\nI'll probably add some logging to SystemdUtils.cpp eventually.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "dgam1", "title": "JSON: Handle option \"resume\" when opening playlists", "body": "The issue I'm trying to fix here is that when you send a JSON query of type \"Player.Open\", using playlistid and position as parameters, the option \"resume\" gets silently ignored. To reproduce it, send these queries (with a loaded video playlist):\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": false}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": 50.0}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": {\"hours\": 0, \"seconds\": 10, \"minutes\": 10, \"milliseconds\": 10}}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes I implemented are:\r\nxbmc/interfaces/json-rpc/PlayerOperations.cpp:\r\nIn CPlayerOperations::Open when opening a playlist by id and position, it doesn't send message TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY anymore but TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, attaching as payload a pointer to a CVariant containing either a double (percentage) or an int (-1 for STARTOFFSET_RESUME or number of seconds offset).\r\n\r\nxbmc/PlayListPlayer.cpp:\r\nPLAYLIST::CPlayListPlayer::OnApplicationMessage, handling the message TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, now reads param2 as the playlistid and the payload pointer as the pointer to the CVariant instance containing the resume value. It will set the current playlist, if needed. Before this patch, this was done in TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY. I removed that part from the handler of the latter message since the only occurrence in the code base of using TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY to open a specific playlist at a specific position was in the JSON handler that I changed above.\r\nAlso, in CPlayListPlayer::Play the start offset and percentage both always get reset.\r\n\r\nxbmc/Application.cpp:\r\nReset the property \"StartPercent\" from m_itemCurrentFile as otherwise the property will be set again on the original item in the playlist, once the playback ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these changes resume works as expected on videos. With music it works when you supply a specific time (but the display will act as if the file is being played from the beginning), percentage and STARTOFFSET_RESUME currently get ignored by the music player, which is outside of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

That function will then check the file for ordered chapters. If the file doesn't use ordered chapters a nullptr is returned, and the factory returns the ffmpeg demuxer as usual.\nIf the file uses ordered chapters a CDemuxTimeline gets created. It takes over the ffmpeg demuxer as \"primaryDemuxer\", and gets returned by the factory instead of the ffmpeg demuxer. The timeline creation may involve searching for missing mkv segments in the same directory as the source file if necessary.\n## Motivation and Context\n\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "DaveTBlake", "title": "Smart playlists: fix how song based rules applied to artists and albums lists", "body": "Since adding role and path rules to \"artists\" type smart playlists I realised that all the rules based on song criteria e.g. genre, path and role, rather than simply a field in the artist table, need to be combined in SQL rather than left as spearate SQL clauses for each rule.\n\nIn logic terms the artists with songs satisfying criteria A and songs satisfying criteria B is not the always same as those artists with songs satisfying criteria A and B.\n\nThe effects of this can be seen in Jarvis with an \"artists\" smart playlist with 2 genre rules: genre = A AND genre = B - what is wanted is all artists with songs that have both genre A and B, what you get is artists that have both at least a song  with genre A and at least a song with genre B. This is not major, but once role and path rule combinations are possible as in v17 then the impact becomes more significant.\n\nAlso having selected a playlist of artists using song criteria when that list is played it is the songs that satisfy those criteraia that are wanted. Say for example the artist has some songs of genre Jazz and other songs are Rock. You make a playlist of Jazz artists i.e. artists with songs of genre = Jazz, then currently when you play that list you would get all the songs by that artist rather than just the Jazz ones. Hence song based rules need transfering to filter the subsequent list of albums or songs shown when navigating down from an artist on smart playlist or when playing that list.\n\nThis is particularly important when there are role rules e.g. \"artist is composer\", currently clicking on a composer from such an artist list can result in nothing being displayed despite the fact thay they do compose some songs because the role rule is not passed to the list of albums or artists.\n", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2016-07-10T10:37:01", "merged_at": null, "comments": 14, "commits": 10, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

He even can activate an auto update feature without user interaction.\n\nIf you wonder why there is a public key in those commits. For security reasons we have to sign the DMG so that the updater can verify that the update is really done by us (i would hook the signing up to the release jenkins job - or the alpha job in case we want to provide alpha update via sparkle).\n\nBasically the signing is done because of the same reasons we have to sign the apk file for android.\n\nWhat do you think? (given the risk free integration we could even think about taking this into 14.2 - once its in we can publish versions via an serverside xml).\n\nAs you can see the updatexml which holds the metadata about available updates can be defined in version.txt (in case we want to have different files for alpha and final releases). For now i just would put them to the osx downloads on the mirror.\n\nOnce we release we just kick the jenkins job (which is not adapted yet) which signs the dmg - the sign process results in an dsa key hash which has to be added to the xml file (this is manual work - like when i update cydia repo).

I know the code is a pile of garbage as-is, but it works for testing and the improvement is substantial. As this change introduces no new dependecies (libjpeg-turbo is already a hard dependecy of Kodi, as I see it) and does not introduce new features (but improves the performance of an existing feature), I opted not to implement it as an addon.

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "AlwinEsch", "title": "[addons] remove cpluff", "body": "## Description\r\nThis request removes the use of \"cpluff\" in Kodi.\r\n\r\n**Why should be cpluff removed:**\r\ncpluff was designed to run a complete addon management. This includes not only loading the addon data, but also using and running these addons.\r\n\r\nKodi has only used the loading of addon.xml. This can also be done quite easily by yourself.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the performance of cpluff is rather bad and Kodi must always retry the data stored in it to create its matching data structure. Therefore, the data passes through twice in the system, once in cpluff and once in Kodi.\r\n\r\nAlso, cpluff does not allow to easily work together multiple addon types in an addon itself, see Binary addons. There is only information related to the respective addon type and no other type in it.\r\n\r\n**What does this:**\r\nIt searches the addons stored in the system or reads the data given by the repository and then creates it from the found xml file. Or by using [CAddonInfoBuilder::CFromDB](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-d468e80a368d09a27acf00bab3edf35fR29) from database.\r\n\r\nFor local addons, the information created with [CAddonInfoBuilder::Generate](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/14908/files#diff-11ac4eb50187a8acb45199c341852086R51) is then stored in the manager (instead of in cpluff). In the case of a request, the associated CAddonInfo will then be issued.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a change, this list will be replaced or an entry removed (as before). Because these are given as shared memory, conflicts are ruled out if used elsewhere (similar to the previous ones where the classes were copied instead).\r\n\r\n**What changed here:**\r\nThis contains only the minimal changes and the access to the AddonManager remains as before.\r\n\r\nOnly the \"FromExtension\" is removed at the respective addon classes and replaced with a new path.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CAddonInfo is no longer passed with a static address but with a shared pointer because the CAddonInfo is already stored in the AddonManager and must remain there.\r\n\r\nThis is another try. But definitely something has to be done because with cpluff, Kodi comes to its limits and the previous code (also by me for advanced abilities) is very disgusted.\r\n\r\nPlease do not come back with \"no, no\", if it does not fit, help me or bring a good one yourself.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nTo finally make the addon system more extensible and secure\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- [X] Test code system added\r\n- [ ] Test with mostly all available addons\r\n- [ ] Test automatic updates\r\n- [x] Test uninstall / update to becomes not more bad\r\n- [ ] Test with bad addon.xml's\r\n- [ ] Test on all OS's (related e.g. to binary download on Windows)\r\n- [x] Confirm current binary addon system works normal\r\n- [X] Repository addon install over ZIP Ok (still need Kodi restart like before, to download included addons)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

This are:\r\n1. Addon class \"CPresentShader\"\r\n    - It allow addon to use Kodi's basic predefined shaders from CRenderSystemGL or CRenderSystemGLES\r\n    - This is then the most easiest way for a addon to get shader. Tested on asteroids screensaver and works good\r\n2. Addon class \"CShader\" and \"CShaderProgram\"\r\n    - This allow the use of more complex shaders where load becomes handled from Kodi. This makes it on addon side more easy to handle differences between different OS's and GL Versions.\r\n    - Before was for more complex OpenGL shading a extra code on addons needed to handle this load.\r\n    - This support the load of Kodi's own shaders or own from addon where it give his folder to Kodi\r\n    - Test of them works good.\r\n3. Addon class \"CMatrix\"\r\n    - It has now a interface for the Matrix Processing on OpenGL\r\n    - This allow the for performance optimized code to use on addon\r\n4. Addon class \"CMatrixStack\"\r\n    - This is a special stack handler, over static functions there can the addon use the Matrix Stack's from Kodi for him.\r\n    - Further can it create the class by self new who make a own stack on addon.\r\n    - This code is currently not tested.\r\n\r\n**Just as an example of an idea, not sure if it's acceptable.

For UDP streams, it is set to false. But this is later overwritten by:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// iformat is NULL because it is a udp stream and we don\u2019t have the format type in advance\r\nelse if (!iformat || (strcmp(iformat->name, \u201cmpegts\u201d) != 0))\r\n{\r\nm_streaminfo = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe must be careful.\r\n\r\n* If we completely disable the streaminfo request, video is not rendered at all.\r\n* Setting the timeout to a hundred milliseconds works, but may not be safe.

This value has been chosen because it is used in ffmpeg and this value is even cited as being set as such to fix slow IPTV channel changes for Kodi. \r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThis has been included in OSMC since early January on Kodi Krypton without reports of issues.\r\nIt has also been included with our Kodi Leia test builds, but this does attract fewer users. \r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

I was thinking about adding an externals folder but with curl maybe ending up being the only wrapper it made little sense.\r\n\r\ng_curlInterface and it's caching of connections is gone to avoid global state management that at best provides a negligible performance increase.\r\n\r\nA very simple class `CCurlGlobalInit` is added that's only job is to init/deinit curl globally and set up locks for static linking.\r\n\r\n### Doubt ###\r\nAfter I started on this I started doubting myself a bit so curious about others thoughts on this. Same goal can probably be achieved with a somewhat redesigned `CCurlFile`.\r\n\r\nMaybe use `std::error_condition` instead of `std::error_code` as I learned that technically std::error_code is for system errors and std::error_condition is for \"other\" errors.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your change in detail -->\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

I open the PR because of #12225 and because I need input on how to handle configuring the list of allowed domains. I also haven't done much testing yet because I don't have a client ready to hand.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nIn general browsers don't allow performing POST requests from one domain to another due to security reasons. This however can stop clients from interacting with Kodi. The solution for this is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which adds additional HTTP headers to the request and responses indicating whether CORS is supported or not.\r\nDue to this being a potential security issue (if not properly configured) CORS is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled by the user in the settings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the proper thing to do would be to ask the user to configure the list of domains which should be allowed to use CORS. This is however very technical and I'm not sure how best to integrate this into the user interface which is why I haven't done it yet. Right now when CORS is enabled the webserver accepts cross domain requests from any domain.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-06-06T07:15:39", "merged_at": null, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "mergeable": true, "review_comments": 2, "state": "open"}

Made existing code more readable, inspired by [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133)\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nWhenever I delete a movie on my NAS, a video library clean on Kodi removes not only the movie from the database, but also the entire path (folder and its movies)! \r\n\r\nI am using a movie structure like this:\r\nSourceVideoFolder (\"Movies\")\r\n---QualityFolder (like \"HD\", \"SD\", \"4k\" etc.)\r\n------YearFolder (like \"1900-1999\", \"2000-2010\" etc)\r\n---------Movies\r\n\r\nThis happens, because in function CleanMediaType() the pathsDeleteDecisions wrongly got only the bool \"del\" (corresponds if the missing movie should be deleted), instead of also checking if the folder still exists. The path shouldn't get deleted if it exists.\r\n\r\nIn [PR8133](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8133) anaconda also ran into a similar issue, as mentioned in the comments (on Oct 25, 2015), but they didn't solve the issue.

It should compile on Android but I didn't runtime test it. OSX/iOS is completely untested.

Furthermore it supports named loggers which should make logging in the code much easier and also make the log file easier to read because every class/instance follows the same guidelines (right now every class logs their class name differently or not at all). As an example I've implemented a named logger for the `CWebServer` class in 9ed2953de94f50cc578cfad1af18b873c33817e7.\r\n\r\nUsing templates I also managed to get rid of the difference between `Log` and `LogW` which makes the interface of `CLog` easier to use.\r\n\r\nI had to fix some log messages (all collected in 6f1e4a6fb0e29fb693270335f1084cb36d41a9b6) because they didn't match in type and therefore weren't type safe.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nLocal testing on windows.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the [Code guidelines](https://codedocs.xyz/xbmc/xbmc/code_guidelines.html) of this project \r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation, either Doxygen or wiki\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n- [ ] better solution for `gai_strerror()` as char/wchar_t\r\n- [ ] fix pkgconfig version\r\n- [ ] fixed width for thread id and log level\r\n- [ ] find a solution for `LOGINFO` vs. `LOGNOTICE`\r\n- [x] add `TARGET_WIN10` defines\r\n- [x] get rid of unnecessary trailing newlines in log messages\r\n- [x] fix crash in `CDVDDemuxClient`", "changed_files": 135, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-03-09T12:51:56", "merged_at": null, "comments": 42, "commits": 6, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 10, "state": "open"}

This will probably replace our current patches in LibreELEC regardless of if they are accepted here or not. If this isn't something that we want in Kodi then it would still be nice to get some comments about the code quality (I'm no c++ dev). \r\n\r\nThis allows running systemd services that are inside the add-on. On LibreELEC because we use Kodi's add-on system as the package manager. We provide binary add-ons that can contain services (like tvheadend, docker, etc). These services are started via systemd service files. We previously maintained an ugly patch to start these services. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/aadeef8bdff40ae19cb61f1206ff30ebbaebb8bb and [here](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv/blob/master/packages/mediacenter/kodi/scripts/systemd-addon-wrapper)\r\n\r\nI wanted to make something that is cleaner and using proper methods. Since Kodi has a DBus method already it was rather simple to use that. So when add-ons are enabled/disabled dbus calls the systemd manager to enable/disable and start/stop service units.\r\n\r\nThe second commit extends this to add timedated support to allow setting the host OS timezone from within kodi. LibreELEC again maintained a patch for this. see, https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/commit/fb5c7a43280419bfa464b945da3b46f74782f0ad\r\n\r\nI decided to only depend on dbus because that's what is done in [LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/powermanagement/linux/LogindUPowerSyscall.cpp) as it doesn't look for systemd or upower.\r\n\r\nI'll probably add some logging to SystemdUtils.cpp eventually.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "dgam1", "title": "JSON: Handle option \"resume\" when opening playlists", "body": "The issue I'm trying to fix here is that when you send a JSON query of type \"Player.Open\", using playlistid and position as parameters, the option \"resume\" gets silently ignored. To reproduce it, send these queries (with a loaded video playlist):\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": false}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": 50.0}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n`{\"params\": {\"item\": {\"position\": 0, \"playlistid\": 1}, \"options\": {\"resume\": {\"hours\": 0, \"seconds\": 10, \"minutes\": 10, \"milliseconds\": 10}}}, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"Player.Open\"}`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes I implemented are:\r\nxbmc/interfaces/json-rpc/PlayerOperations.cpp:\r\nIn CPlayerOperations::Open when opening a playlist by id and position, it doesn't send message TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY anymore but TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, attaching as payload a pointer to a CVariant containing either a double (percentage) or an int (-1 for STARTOFFSET_RESUME or number of seconds offset).\r\n\r\nxbmc/PlayListPlayer.cpp:\r\nPLAYLIST::CPlayListPlayer::OnApplicationMessage, handling the message TMSG_PLAYLISTPLAYER_PLAY, now reads param2 as the playlistid and the payload pointer as the pointer to the CVariant instance containing the resume value. It will set the current playlist, if needed. Before this patch, this was done in TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY. I removed that part from the handler of the latter message since the only occurrence in the code base of using TMSG_MEDIA_PLAY to open a specific playlist at a specific position was in the JSON handler that I changed above.\r\nAlso, in CPlayListPlayer::Play the start offset and percentage both always get reset.\r\n\r\nxbmc/Application.cpp:\r\nReset the property \"StartPercent\" from m_itemCurrentFile as otherwise the property will be set again on the original item in the playlist, once the playback ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these changes resume works as expected on videos. With music it works when you supply a specific time (but the display will act as if the file is being played from the beginning), percentage and STARTOFFSET_RESUME currently get ignored by the music player, which is outside of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Types of change\r\n<!--- What type of change does your code introduce?

That function will then check the file for ordered chapters. If the file doesn't use ordered chapters a nullptr is returned, and the factory returns the ffmpeg demuxer as usual.\nIf the file uses ordered chapters a CDemuxTimeline gets created. It takes over the ffmpeg demuxer as \"primaryDemuxer\", and gets returned by the factory instead of the ffmpeg demuxer. The timeline creation may involve searching for missing mkv segments in the same directory as the source file if necessary.\n## Motivation and Context\n\n<!--- Why is this change required?

{"repo_fullname": "xbmc/xbmc", "user": "DaveTBlake", "title": "Smart playlists: fix how song based rules applied to artists and albums lists", "body": "Since adding role and path rules to \"artists\" type smart playlists I realised that all the rules based on song criteria e.g. genre, path and role, rather than simply a field in the artist table, need to be combined in SQL rather than left as spearate SQL clauses for each rule.\n\nIn logic terms the artists with songs satisfying criteria A and songs satisfying criteria B is not the always same as those artists with songs satisfying criteria A and B.\n\nThe effects of this can be seen in Jarvis with an \"artists\" smart playlist with 2 genre rules: genre = A AND genre = B - what is wanted is all artists with songs that have both genre A and B, what you get is artists that have both at least a song  with genre A and at least a song with genre B. This is not major, but once role and path rule combinations are possible as in v17 then the impact becomes more significant.\n\nAlso having selected a playlist of artists using song criteria when that list is played it is the songs that satisfy those criteraia that are wanted. Say for example the artist has some songs of genre Jazz and other songs are Rock. You make a playlist of Jazz artists i.e. artists with songs of genre = Jazz, then currently when you play that list you would get all the songs by that artist rather than just the Jazz ones. Hence song based rules need transfering to filter the subsequent list of albums or songs shown when navigating down from an artist on smart playlist or when playing that list.\n\nThis is particularly important when there are role rules e.g. \"artist is composer\", currently clicking on a composer from such an artist list can result in nothing being displayed despite the fact thay they do compose some songs because the role rule is not passed to the list of albums or artists.\n", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2016-07-10T10:37:01", "merged_at": null, "comments": 14, "commits": 10, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

He also can decide to skip only one version of kodi or if he doesn't want to update now he can delay it. He even can activate an auto update feature without user interaction.\n\nIf you wonder why there is a public key in those commits. For security reasons we have to sign the DMG so that the updater can verify that the update is really done by us (i would hook the signing up to the release jenkins job - or the alpha job in case we want to provide alpha update via sparkle).\n\nBasically the signing is done because of the same reasons we have to sign the apk file for android.\n\nWhat do you think? (given the risk free integration we could even think about taking this into 14.2 - once its in we can publish versions via an serverside xml).\n\nAs you can see the updatexml which holds the metadata about available updates can be defined in version.txt (in case we want to have different files for alpha and final releases). For now i just would put them to the osx downloads on the mirror.\n\nOnce we release we just kick the jenkins job (which is not adapted yet) which signs the dmg - the sign process results in an dsa key hash which has to be added to the xml file (this is manual work - like when i update cydia repo).

I am using iPhone SE and standard WebView font size sometimes very difficult to read so I decided to contribute a bit to the project.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains from 2 major parts:\r\n1. View element that display quick settings for changing font size (it's small orange box on the right bottom corner with the arrow). I decided to create this instead of putting this to common settings for two reasons: the first one - I found it's not easy to understand philosophy of settings screen at all and the second is that's much more intuitive to change font size right in context of viewing a file.\r\n\r\n2. The second part is about actually changing the font and storing it between app launches. For storing data I used `[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]` but not sure if it's correct or not, because in some places app uses defaults for domain and in some - standard.\r\n\r\nFor handling changes I added observer for this property in user defaults.\r\n\r\nAnd for actually setting font size I used js string `document.body.style.fontSize = '%@';` in the `webView`. Sizes are provided in `%` to reflect user defined settings for the system fonts and default value is `100%`.\r\n\r\nBugs: I found that with some sizes update did not work (for example when font size changed from 400% to 420% then to 440% e.t.c.) but after closing the view and opening it again it uses correct size. I am not sure why it happens, maybe some MobileSafari specific.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nMaks", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": null, "created_at": "2017-10-22T17:28:38", "merged_at": null, "comments": 4, "commits": 5, "mergeable": false, "review_comments": 0, "state": "open"}

Either you or a supporter signed this repo up for Open Collective. This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/OnionBrowser\u2764\ufe0f\r\n\r\nIt adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner). See how it looks on this [repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).\r\n\r\nYou can also add a postinstall script to let people know after npm|yarn install that you are welcoming donations (optional).
